## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'd like to see the object browser in the admin console take on a new capability.

Somehow, I would like to display, for a given object, the list of clients where it resides.  This will really help me understand where and how objects are faulted.

Maybe it's possible to put together an object browser per node, so that it would show me the tree that is resident on each node, and the main browser that exists today would allow me to see the whole tree, but give me info on where objects are residing.

</div>

We did 1/2 of this feature, but in the cluster browser it is likely to be useful to give a list of resident nodes.
