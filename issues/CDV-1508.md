## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The express toolkit does not support an "unclustered" mode of operation. Some of the underlying data structures (eg. CDM) have local only fallback implementations although I don't know if all of the "new" types do (like the toolkit queue or text bucket). 

This feature would be to have a good story for toolkit usage without a TC cluster present. This use case is mostly desired for testing scenarios I believe
