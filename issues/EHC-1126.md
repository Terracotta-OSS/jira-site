PFA patch for code changes in AttributeType class.

Code changes will also be required in expression classes like EqualTo, etc available in package 
``` java.net.sf.ehcache.search.expression.* ```


Do let me know, if I can also provide the code changes for the same or there is already some work in progress on the same.
