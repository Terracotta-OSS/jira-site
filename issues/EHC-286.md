This turns out to be pretty hard to do.  Here's a way to do it (to a cache that is already part of a CacheManager):

    cache.getCacheEventNotificationService().getCacheEventListeners().add(myListener);

Doing it through configuration is even weirder and should be something along the lines of:

   cache.getCacheConfiguration().addCacheEventListenerFactory(myFactory);

where factory is something I'm able to define.

In any case, it should be documented here: http://ehcache.org/documentation/cache\_event\_listeners.html
