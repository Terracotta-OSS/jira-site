## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The GzipFilter does not check the response code before
comressing content.    if the response is a 304, then it 
is not permitted to have any content - but gzip will
always produce at least 20 bytes even if there was zero
bytes written.

Servlet containers should discard those bytes for you,
but there is nothing in the servlet spec that says how
this should be done.  It would be legal for the container 
to close the output stream so the gzip filter would
encounter exceptions when trying to write these bytes.
