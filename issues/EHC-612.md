## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a project at forge/projects/labs/EhcacheDemo that programatically constructs CacheManagers and Caches.  I get this log warning each time a cache is created:

The attribute "coherentReads" in "terracotta" element is deprecated and is overrided by the value of the new "coherent"
 attribute (defaults to "true"). Please use the new "coherent" attribute instead.


</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

coherentReads has been deprecated in favor of coherent.
do you see this issue if set "coherent" attribute

</div>
