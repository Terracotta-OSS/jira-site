## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi

This problem happens with versions 1.2.4 and 1.3-beta2

I try to put into cache lots of data and after about 400,000 elements I get
OutOfMemoryException even though my maxElementsInMemory is only 10.

the cache is cofigured as:
eternal = false
overflowToDisk = true
maxElementsInMemory = 10 maxElementsOnDisk = 0 memoryStoreEvictionPolicy =
FIFO
timeToLiveSeconds = 0
timeToIdleSeconds = 0
diskPersistent = true
diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds = 120

The code is very simple

Element a = null;
for (i = 0; i < 100000; i++)
\{
String key = i + "aaaaaaa..............";
String value = key;
a = new Element(key,value);
cache.put(a);
\}

I execute java with -Xmx1024m -server parameters
I tried to increase -Xmx setting, but it didn't help

Should I be checking status of the writing threat or DiskStore before doing put?

The exception is :

Hi

I am glad you reported this. Early versions of ehcache had quite slow DiskStore puts due to the way the synchronization worked. The DiskStores were slow. I fixed that up and made puts fast. However they are too fast. If you do a huge load of puts to overflow to the disk the spool will keep growing and you could run out of memory.

I had assumed that because no one had reported this that with large server apps the memory was high and the chance of an out of memory error was very low. Ehcache itself is hardened in most places where out of memory error can happen.

However with your report I have implemented a back off method that makes puts wait 5ms if the spool is using more than 20MB. Not sure if this is going to suit everyone either. I have added a configuration option - diskSpoolBufferSizeMB - so that you can set it.

The default is 30MB. Tune this lower if you need to.

I would appreciate it if you could thoroughly test this. 

Greg
