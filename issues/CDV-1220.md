## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In this forum post two interesting things happened: 

(1) The user could not figure out from the error message what to do
(2) The user was thought providing different names would define different servers

This JIRA item is to evaluate whether we should either update the error message, this would address (1). The message should maybe include the "names" to help illuminate the issue

Or perhaps we should treat "name" as the hostname if it is not defined in the <server> element. This seems to have been the users expectation.

If host element is not provided, then make it default to the server name.

Also when improve the error message.

Tested with Terracotta Enterprise 3.0.1-nightly, as of 20090421-150439 (Revision 3896-12542 by cruise@su10mo5 from 3.0), 2009-04-21 17:05:02,750 INFO - Terracotta 3.0.1-nightly, as of 20090421-080405 (Revision 12542 by cruise@su10mo5 from 3.0),
it is working as expected when only name is included in the <server> element i.e., it is treating the name as hostname.

Steps:
1. Install the 3.0.1-nightly-ee
2. created the tc-config.xml under bin with name as "localhost"

<servers>
<server name="localhost">
<data>terracotta/server-data/data</data>
<l2-group-port>9530</l2-group-port>
<dso>
<persistence>
<mode>permanent-store</mode>
</persistence>
</dso>
</server>
<server name="backup">
<data>terracotta/backup-data</data>
<l2-group-port>9530</l2-group-port>
<dso>
<persistence>
<mode>permanent-store</mode>
</persistence>
</dso>
</server>
<ha>
<mode>networked-active-passive</mode>
<networked-active-passive>
<election-time>5</election-time>
</networked-active-passive>
</ha>
</servers>
3. execute bin/start-tc-server.bat -f tc-config.xml -n localhost

Actual: server started successfully

4. Install 3.0.1-nightly

5. created the tc-config.xml under bin with name as "localhost"
<servers>
<server name="server1">
<data>terracotta/server-data/ws-cm-17-data</data>
<l2-group-port>9530</l2-group-port>
<dso>
<persistence>
<mode>permanent-store</mode>
</persistence>
</dso>
</server>
</servers>
6.  execute bin/start-tc-server.bat 

Actual: server started successfully
