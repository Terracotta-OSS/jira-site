## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I would find it useful if for the diskStore path I could 
specify a subdirectory of the java.io.tmpdir (for 
example), and have ehcache create that directory.

eg

path="java.io.tmpdir/myapplication"

I have several webapplications that will run in the same 
Tomcat and will have the cache names.

cheers,
Karl
