## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

source: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/1282.page

Something about the local monitor acquires we introduce here seems busted. My guess is that we're missing a monitorexit when an exception is being thrown. The sun java runtime detects imbalance in monitors when exiting methods and throws IllegalMonitorStateException if not enough releases happen. Another possibility is that we're doing too many releases.

This was with 1.5.0\104 JDK and TC 2.6.1, but I believe this problem exists for any JDK version and all TC versions (or perhaps only since it was made partial in the L1)

Attached is the IllegalMonitorStateException that the user saw. Also attached is a ClassNotFoundException that I think is the precursor to the IllegalMonitorStateException (cnfe.txt) by the same user

This synch seems to be sprinkled about and coming up with someting less fragile might take a while. I think this a 2-3 day task to get right

rewrote the lazy faulting to be in synchronized methods of CHM$HashEntry, as opposed to inlining the synchronization in all the other classes that do direct field access
