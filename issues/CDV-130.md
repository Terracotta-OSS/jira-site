<div markdown="1" class="comment">

At the moment, the only need to for this postCreateMethod is to call \_\_tc\_rehash on instances of ConcurrentHashMap. I changed the implementation to use reflection instead of beanshell for this one (regular onLoad stuff is still bean shell). Simply moving the call to be outside the synch of the ClientObjManager is not trivial, although it would have been a preferred solution.
