## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Multiple documents/forum posts mention that there will be a sample tc.properties file, but I can't find it in the kit:

http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Configuration+Guide+and+Reference#ConfigurationGuideandReference-Overridingtc.properties:

"Every Terracotta installation has a default tc.properties file containing system properties. Normally, the settings in tc.properties are pre-tuned and should not be edited."

https://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/2335.page:
"All of the properties are documented in the tc.properties file for 3.1 branch."

I think the reference might be to the tc.properties that is available as a resource inside tc.jar  (com/tc/properties/tc.properties)
