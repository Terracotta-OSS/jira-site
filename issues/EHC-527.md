## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently a probe with an expired license will stop working and must be restarted to pull a new license from the server and start working again.  It would be cool if the server could be restarted with a new license later and the probe could then pull that new license and start working again without needing a restart.  

Similarly, the probe should be able to pull a new user/password later.

We should talk through this use-case. Currently the probe just sits idle after registration with the server waiting for the server to collect stats or call operations. The server only does that when the GUI is actually used, so there can be a long period where that doesn't happen. Should we add a server ping thread to the probe to check for this, I personally don't like that very much in terms of architecture but I can't really think of another easy to use solution.

I think it would be better for the probe to call into the server for the license. Changing licenses requires a new build of your app and deploy.

Greg, the probe already calls into the server for the license. This Jira talks about getting a new license when the license that the probe received at startup has expired. This would allow users to on-the-fly upgrade to a valid license without having to restart anything.

Old feature idea. Let end users determine required features.
