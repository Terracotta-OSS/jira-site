## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I used %d to indicate where to put client logs because I need to run multiple clients using the same tc-config.xml, and I noticed that %d behaves in a weird way:

<clients>
   <logs>/tmp/client/logs/%d</logs>
 </clients>

Using this tc-config.xml with 2.2.1 kit results in creation of 2 directories:

/tmp/client/logs/terracotta\1data  (\1=some number)
/tmp/terracotta\1data

The second directory is empty and the first one contains the expected log files.

From looking at the code, %d means substitute the value of File.createTempDirectory("terracotta", "data"), which creates /tmp/terracotta\1data.  But then it should substitute that absolute pathname into the pattern you specify, which should have created /tmp/client/logs//tmp/terracotta\1data.

There are several things wrong with com.tc.config.schema.dynamic.ParameterSubstitutor:
(1) It should use everything prefixing %d as the directory in which to create the temporary subdirectory, using File.createTempDirectory("terracotta", "data", new File("/tmp/client/logs/")).
(2) the suffix "data" should be something like "tmp."
(3) After %d is used, if you try to use it again in another config path, it will retain the old value because it gets stored in a static.

You can misuse %d by not using it as a prefix.
