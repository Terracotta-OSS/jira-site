## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

For the method 

public Element get(final Object key) throws LockTimeoutException \{

This call gets the underlying object, and Blocks if a null element is returned.

            final Element element = cache.get(key);
            if (element != null) {
                //ok let the other threads in
                lock.release();
                return element;
            } else {
                //don't release the read lock until we put
                return null;
            }

If a RuntimeException is thrown with "cache.get()", then the BlockingCache will be left in a blocking state. 

In my experience, an IOException was thrown in cache.get() and wrapped as a RuntimeException by the SpringJdbcStore. 

Perhaps the documentation can be changed to help warn other developers who may run into the same problem.

"Note. If a LockTimeoutException or RuntimeException is thrown while doing a \{@link #get\} it means the lock was never acquired,"

Hi

Sorry you got caught by that. I think it is a documentation issue. I have changed the javadoc as follows:

/\*\*
     * Looks up an entry.  Blocks if the entry is null until a call to {@link #put} is done
     * to put an Element in.
     * <p/>
     * If a put is not done, the lock is never released.
     * <p/>
     * If this method throws an exception, it is the responsibility of the caller to catch that exception and call 
     * <code>put(new Element(key, null));</code> to release the lock acquired. See {@link net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.SelfPopulatingCache}
     * for an example.
     * 
     * Note. If a LockTimeoutException is thrown while doing a {@link #get} it means the lock was never acquired,
     * therefore it is a threading error to call {@link #put}
     *
     * @throws LockTimeoutException if timeout millis is non zero and this method has been unable to
     *                              acquire a lock in that time
     * @throws RuntimeException if thrown the lock will not released. Catch and call<code>put(new Element(key, null));</code> 
     * to release the lock acquired.    
     */

That should alert developers accordingly as to the contract.

Thanks for pointing this out.

The fix is in trunk and will be in ehcache-1.5.0 which will be out this weekend.
