## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Ehcache servlet filter doesn't rewrites HTTP response headers (Cache-Control, Pragma). So, browsers doesn't caches such pages.

For example, I'm using ehcache servlet filter with application, that returns next headers:

Cache-Control: no-cache,no-store,private
Pragma:no-cache

So, this headers after ehcache servlet filter are still the same.

For example, OsCache servlet filter rewrites Cache-Control header with max-age parameter, and it returns Last-Modified response header. Using this headers client browser is caches pages in browser cache.


So, there is a wish for ehcache servlet filter rewriting of HTTP response headers to achieve browser caching.
