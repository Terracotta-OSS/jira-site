## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This hasn't been done yet since I need time to decide how to best do this. At the moment the only option seems to be to start a reference to the store in the ElementEvictionData instance, which feels yucky to me. I thought I could detect which type of element eviction data is supported by a store, however this doesn't work since the ClusteredStore has to be able to accept both the DefaultElementEvictionData and ClusteredElementEvictionData to be able to convert from one to the other.

Moving to Fremantle for consideration. If this should be reviewed earlier please assign to Issue Review Board

Is this still relevant to anything anymore?

Chris can we close this out as no longer relevant?

I believe with toolkit-2 that ClusteredElementEvictionData is no longer used - and that we now have a single implementation of ElementEvictionData.  Could someone on the serverteam confirm this and then assign back to me?  I can then close this JIRA and file a new one about cleaning up the whole ElementEvictionData concept.  Thanks!

That seems right.
Only 1 implementation of ElementEvictionData exists now.

It seems that the whole ElementEvictionData abstraction is now unnecessary.  I'll file a new JIRA for replacing the related code.
