## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Ensure memory consumption of the probe is within the agreed amount. The probe is meant to have a light impact.

I think we said about 1 MB. 

In particular if Jetty is creating thread pools, each thread may, depending on Xss and architecture be using commonly 512KB per thread. So we are possibly way over this limit right now.

I guess you've been doing this already so I'll assign it to you...

Greg & I did some very superficial analysis using my sample app and visual VM. 

Results as follows. App with 1 cache manager (ie one probe), 7 caches each with 6 items. No put/get activity.

Without probe:
4 threads
500k heap

With probe:
9 threads
1.3MB heap

Note 5 threads implies ~2.5MB of additional RAM, thus total mem overhead of probe is about 3MB s desired 1MB

Will wait for the updated version of ehcache-dx.

Attached ehcache-dx-memory project which 

# Creates 5 Cache Managers w/ 5 Caches each
# Populates caches w/ 1000 elements
# Can be run w/ & w/o Ehcache DX Monitor using -Dehcachedx.enabled=true


Used Yourkit Profile to compare the Memory footprint.

||Case||Diff in Memory||
|Ehcache Dx Enabled \\(w/ few operations on the console) vs Ehcache Dx Disabled|1,143,472 bytes|

Also tested the memory increase on doing operations on Dx console and just enabling the probe.
