## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi
    We are looking at using ehcache in a larger project
and so I checked out the code from CVS on March-11-2005
(2:45 PM).

    While doing a "ant build", I get an Junit error,
shown below.
Should I be concerned about this or why am I getting
this. I did
not change anything at all in the ehcache.xml.
    Using JDK-1.4.2_07.

Regards
A. J. Rajkumar

I believe these are performance tests and may be failing because of:
a) the speed of the machines
b) other processes running during the test run
c) not running from the command line

In any case this is not a patch

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
