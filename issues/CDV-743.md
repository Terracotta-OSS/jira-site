## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently you can only start the SVT by launching the console, then connecting to some server, then launching the SVT.  This is inconvenient when you just need to look at a snapshot and may not have a running tc server.  We should provide a script to facilitate starting SVT outside the admin console.  Geert provided this command line:

java -cp h2-1.0.67.jar:tc.jar:commons-httpclient-3.0.1.jar:jcommon-1.0.12.jar:jfreechart-1.0.7.jar:svt.jar org.terracotta.tools.SnapshotVisualizer

This manifest file makes java -jar svt.jar work.

Update the svt.jar as follows:

jar ufm svt.jar META-INF/MANIFEST.MF

this would be nice to have at some point. If anyone wants to take time to do it feel free.

Seems like we should be able to get Maven to create the Manifest Class-Path based on the pom dependencies.

I wasn't able to update the jar that way, but the attached MANIFEST.MF worked well when I rebuilt the jar with it.

I went this route because my View button doesn't work when I start the admin console by itself (from Window's Start menu), even though it does work when I start the admin console from the Welcome app.
