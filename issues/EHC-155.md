## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm using EHCache 1.3.0-beta. In net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.addCacheNoCheck(), the defaultCache is cloned. However, in the implementation of this clone() operation, the member variable "CacheConfiguration configuration" is left untouched. Later, the cache that is thus cloned is given a new name through the setName() method. As it forwards this to the configuration member, ALL cloned caches get the new name. This seems to me not correct. I see that this new member has been added after version 1.2.4.
