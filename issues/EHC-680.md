## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There is still a race condition in this method, where the replace isn't actually checking for the Cache being replaced to still be the same instance.
One solution I can think of is replacing the Map<String, Ehcache> ehcaches to have its values replaced by some CacheHolder that would properly override the Object.equals(Object): boolean to check for object identity when the ConcurrentMap.replace is actually being executed

Looks like this works actually. equals being based on the cache's GUID and CacheManager.replaceCacheWithDecoratedCache does the replace. I even wrote a test for that, proving it did work... Probably forgot to close this...
