## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Support is pretty easy to add if we agree that the returned data doesn't have to follow \1any\1 consistency rule: no isolation level, no copy on read/write and unresolved in-doubt data (ie: softlocks).

This obviously has zero impact on all other cache work: puts keep the full transactional guarantee and direct cache access (not through the UnlockedReadsView) keeps working the same.

I would be really happy if this would be implemented. I don't see any alternative to get access to uncommitted elements without using TerracottaStore.
