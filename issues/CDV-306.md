## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

User(s) of wicket 1.3 config bundle report that they had to add more Configuration to tc-config.xml to get Wicket 1.3 to cluster correctly (ofcourse after including the published Wicket 1.3 module)- could we investigate if this is an edge-case that was not covered by the config-bundle provided.

<include>
  <class-expression>org.apache.wicket.MetaDataEntry</class-expression> 
  </include>
..........
<transient-fields>
  <field-name>org.apache.wicket.MetaDataEntry.object</field-name> 
  </transient-fields>

I don't know much about this class but for what's here http://jsourcery.com/api/sourceforge/wicket/1.2.4/wicket/MetaDataEntry.html

The MetaDataEntry class itself should be included automatically, because it has IClusterable marker interface (in Wicket 1.3), but I don't know what kind of stuff is stored in the object field. So, it would be great to get some input from Wicket developers.
