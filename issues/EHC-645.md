## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently keys are unlocked during the rollback of a prepared transaction only if an element has been put back in the store (from the oldVersionStore).
Yet a key that was previously absent from the store has no matching element in the oldVersionStore, resulting in the writeLock acquired during prepare for the key to no be unlocked during rollback!
