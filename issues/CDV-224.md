## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Seems like we should take our one sample that uses jetty and have it use the latest one and take advantage of tims work to get a jetty config module in place.

to whoever this get assigned to -- the sharedqueue sample app doesn't need the jetty config plugin in it's current form. The Jetty plugin only currently does instrumentation on Jetty's class loaders which aren't used unless Jetty is the main class, or you're using a full fledged web app. I guess the test here is that (a) the latest jetty is in fact being used, and (b) the thing fails miserably if the jetty config plugin is not enabled in tc-config

As of rev 2754 the demo now uses jetty 6.1.1
I'd mark this one as resolve except for (from above):

   (b) the thing fails miserably if the jetty config plugin is not enabled in tc-config

Why should it fail if the jetty plugin is not in the tc-config when it doesn't even need it?

Could you please comment on these, or should I mark it as resolved already?
Tnx

I didn't understand your question about why it fails without the plugin but I think you can close it.

Doesn't look like Juris and Steve have come to conclusion on this one.
