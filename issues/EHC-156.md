## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I use ehcache-1.3.0-beta.

After I create several caches with CacheManager.getInstance().addCache(name) with different name Strings all the caches return the same String for cache.getName().

It seems that the name is always the name of the last cache that was added. Of course, I don't want all my caches to have the same name.

In my ehcache.xml is only a defaultCache configuration and no cache definitions for any of the names that I use. This is fine because the default config is ok for all my caches.

Apparently this issue has also been reported by a poster on the forum: https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread\1id=1718805&forum\1id=322280

Attached is my ehcache.xml.
