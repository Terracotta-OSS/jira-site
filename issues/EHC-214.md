## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Reading the XML configuration as an inputstream, EHCache does not take into account the character encoding used (UTF-8), but instead converts every byte to a character. This causes the folowing error: Error configuring from input stream. Initial cause was Invalid byte 2 of 3-byte UTF-8 seqquence.

See for details the class ConfigurationFactory, method "private static InputStream translateSystemProperties(InputStream inputStream)".


Wrong code:

while ((c = inputStream.read()) != -1) \{
    stringBuffer.append((char) c);
\}


But the inputStream should be wrapped by a reader to the handle the character encoding correct, for example to decode UTF-8. For correct usage the encoding of the XML should be determined.

Reader lReader = new InputStreamReader(inputStream, "UTF-8");
while ((c = lReader.read()) != -1) \{
    stringBuilder.append((char) c);
\}
