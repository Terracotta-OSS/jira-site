## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Given that the iterators on CSM are backed by Hashtable's iterators they are probably fail-fast and will throw ConcurrentModification exception. For any real world usage of CSM I'd think the iterators would be completely useless for this reason. Seems like we should either make them more like ConcurrentHashMap's weakly consistent iterators or not support them at all. 

note: I haven't actually tested this, but I'm almost certain sure it is the case
