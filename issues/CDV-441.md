## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/496.page

Looking at the attached stack trace, we cause org.jboss.net.protocol.URLStreamHandlerFactory.createURLStreamHandler() to be re-entered. That JBoss code uses a thread local to try to deal with re-entrancy, but in the end the effect is that the VM falls back to using the sun.\* stream handler types instead of JBoss'  internal handlers.

There doesn't seem to be a huge impact to this, but it does dramatically increase the number of simultaneous open file handles when the URLDeploymentScanner runs. It ends up using sun's file:// handler and doesn't close them. The file handles are eventually closed, but only after a GC runs and some finalizers get kicked off.
