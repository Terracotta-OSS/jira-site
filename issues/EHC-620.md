## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hibernate 3.5 will be adding two new methods to the Hibernate caching API, Region.contains(Object key) and RegionFactory.getDefaultAccessType().  We should add support for them so that we continue to work after 3.5 is released.

</div>

Added new methods, but left Hibernate dependency in pom.xml as is.  I'll JIRA moving ehcache-core to depend on Hibernate 3.5 when it gets released.
