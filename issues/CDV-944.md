## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Use of the Lock Profiler with a non-zero trace-depth against a cluster that is heavily loaded can cause the cluster clients to disconnect and the server to terminate.  Stack traces coupled with a large numbers of locks results in the server transactions rate -> 0.
