The reporter of this issue is a member of the Apache DirectMemory team.  I'm assuming that he wants this change so that people can plug Apache DirectMemory in to Ehcache instead of using our solution.  It saddens me that he isn't or felt he couldn't be upfront about this purpose in the first place.  I'm not going to act on this until I get some very high-up approval for obvious reasons.

Might be worthwhile noting that he's actually complaining about needing to have a class in the net.sf.ehcache package to plug his own implementation in, as we don't do anything to make sure the net.sf.ehcache.store.offheap.OffHeapStore is actually ours! 
Based on what I understood from chatting with him at Devoxx in Paris, he actually has his own implementation already (no idea whether it works), but complains about having to have his own net.sf.ehcache.store.offheap.OffHeapStore class, which isn't in a org.apache package (or whatever one he uses).

I wonder why this 3-line patch has not yet been merged...

It would mean Store becomes public API. We're not inclined to make that happen yet. 
There isn't a single store that's pluggable like that neither; be it memory, disk or clustered.
We cleaned up bunch of that internal wiring in 2.7 bunch we are not quite to the stage of being able to make such a move. 
It isn't about merging a 3-line patch really, but being able to support what it entails. I did talk to Olivier face to face about this problem already.
