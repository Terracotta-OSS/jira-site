## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

tim-distributed-cache/src/main/java/org/terracotta/cache/impl/LocalCache.java

A handful of methods in there throw UnsupportedOperationException (likely needlessly). Review the exceptions and update test that excercises map w/o TC

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

One thing to note here is that both values() and containsValue() in the the TC clustered distributed cache implementation throw UnsupportedOperationException as well.  My vague recollection is that this was due to concerns about the performance (and possibly the incoherent nature) of these operations on a clustered cache.  Hence the UnsupportedOperationException should stay on these methods unless we add implementations to the clustered one too.  This doesn't excuse us from implementing the other methods correctly though.

Does this affect express?

This doesn't really affect express since you can't (currently) get unclustered instances of the toolkit datatypes. 

Given Chris' comments I'm content to just close this out now since we probably want parity between the clustered and unclustered implementations

closing this for now since we want to maintain parity between the clustered and unclustered versions
