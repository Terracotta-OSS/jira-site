## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If a cache is created and then more than one thread invokes BlockingCache.get(Object key) and then into BlockingCache.getCacheLockProvider() at the same time, there's a chance that more than one thread will invoke the line.
this.cacheLockProvider = new StripedReadWriteLockSync(stripes);

Which means that for a small fraction of time, different callers will be using a different set of locks.

The cache lock provider should be created together with the BlockingCache to avoid this.
