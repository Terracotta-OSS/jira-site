## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

For example, if we have ehcache in a cluster of three nodes, two of the nodes run outside of Weblogic in their  standalone JVM.  The other node is running inside Weblogic server, and we don't want to cache data locally in Weblogic server.  That is to make as much heap memory available to our application running inside Weblogic's JVM.  May be it is nice to have a JVM flag to disable cache locally, or in the ehcache config file, or in the code.
