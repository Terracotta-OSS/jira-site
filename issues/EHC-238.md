## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It'd be nice to have the ability to include and exclude certain URLs from being Gzipped. For example, my app works fine with GzipFilter enabled, but my XFire service listing (at http://localhost:8080/services), doesn't work. It'd be nice to be able to specify an init-param that excludes zipping this particular URL.

In general, it'd be nice to have AntPath support for including and excluding patterns so /\* could be used, and then adjustments can be made in the filter's configuration.
