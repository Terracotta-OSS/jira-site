## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

To remotely connect jconsole to the server jconsole needs tc.jar in it's classpath to get access to the jmxremote\_optional classes.  A script should be added to the kit that runs jconsole for remote access to the server.

Find prototype versions of those scripts attached.

We need to update our online doc regarding to this setup too. We kept mentioning jconsole support in our doc (JMX API part), but never really mentioned about hte correct URL and jars to be included, which has caused lots of confusion.

If we need a new JIRA for Doc, I will be happy to do so.
