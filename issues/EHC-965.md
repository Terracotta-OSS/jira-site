## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

had been using  ehcache-core-2.5.0.jar
with absolutely no problems on mac osx 10.6.8

Dropped in the new library, but the file names are 'corrupted'
as the following 
"%0054o%0044o%0043ache%0044omain%004bey%0052ank.data"
prior to this they were displayed correctly
"ToDoCacheDomainKeyRank.data"

Looks like it does not like uppercase file names.

I'll admit that those file names aren't particularly pretty anymore but we did fix an issue where data files on disk would collide for cache names that differed only by case (eg. "Cache1" vs. "cache1") 

Previously those would not "work" on file systems that are not case sensitive (like windows and OSX -- which are merely case preserving).

One unfortunately side effect is that all uppercase letters turn into that funny looking encoded form, but that is the actual name of the file on disk

I can think of better solutions than this stupidity...........

1. Don't allow mixed character names.
2. Automatically name the files, but tag internally.
3. Add a suffix/prefix to names that clash.
