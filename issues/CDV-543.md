## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

046 public class Main extends JFrame implements ActionListener, ChatterDisplay,
047       WindowListener \{
048 
049    private final ChatManager chatManager = new ChatManager();
050 
051    private final JTextPane display = new JTextPane();
052 
053    private User user;
054 
055    private final JList buddyList = new JList();
056 
057    private boolean isServerDown = false;
058    private static final String CHATTER\_SYSTEM = "SYSTEM";
059 
060    public Main() \{
061       try \{
062          final String nodeId = registerForNotifications();
063          user = new User(nodeId, this);
064          populateCurrentUsers();
065          login();
066       \}

between lines 49 and 65, there is a race - since the login method sets up a local listener for all chat events, it's easy to lose the other client login if execution of 1 node is between 49 and 65, and the other completes 65 (the login process)

Kalai this may be related to the issue you saw in chatter this week?

Tested with 2.5.1 rev6793, it is working as expected.

1. Install the kit
2. Start the demo server 
3. Launch the chatter demo

Actual: username and client node Id are displayed in the chatter demo and in th admin console 

demo.chatter.Main.chatManager(dem.chater.chatManager)
demo.chatter.Main.chatManager.users(java.util.TreeMap
value(demo.chatter.User)
demo.chatter.User.name(String): user name is displayed
demo.chatter.User.nodeId(String):clientID[0]

You have to start the two clients at the same time.  Human time will not show this race.  Maven usually starts them close enough.

See Glassfish changes.

To verify the fix on this the only way to see the issue is to start multiple instances, really really quickly/really at the same time.  
The best way to do this is to automate it.

Tim has fixed this in the tc-2.5 branch of this project. Juris/Jason just needs to make a new release.

I already ported this fix in the tc-2.5 branch of chatter in the Forge. This issue should be fixed in release-1.0.2 - Jason has to release the Forge core artifacts before we could create a new release.

Also, Kalai should be able to verify this by checking out:  https://svn.terracotta.org/repo/forge/projects/chatter/branches/tc-2.5

Retested this issue with chatter-1.0.3-SNAPSHOT.jar from tc-2.5 branch. It is working as expected.

Steps to reproduce:
1. svn co https://svn.terracotta.org/repo/forge/projects/chatter/branches/tc-2.5
2. Verify that the tc-2.5 is created
3. cd tc-2.5
4. mvn clean install
5. mvn clean tc:run

Actual: DSO Server started successfully and chatter window1 and chatter window2 are displayed in the same time with list of names.
