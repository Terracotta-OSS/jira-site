## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need to add a test for this common scenario where CacheManagers are not named - the clustered identity mechanism should deal with this scenario and properly cluster caches in the default CacheManager space.

Think this is handled but need to add a test for a CacheManager with no name.

Added call to CacheManager.isNamed() and I'm now checking that flag in TerracottaStoreFactory.create() and if no name is defined, a default ("\_\_DEFAULT\_\_") is used instead.
