## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a maven project has tests, among the artifacts it generates are jar files of its tests.
We should investigate if it's possible to run these tests on the client side.

Here's a test of how the --run-tests option will work:

   $ ./tim-get install tim-foobar --run-tests

Will end up downloading the TIM jar file including the tests jar file (if any were produced) and will run the tests before installing the TIM. Or install the TIMs and run the tests... not very clear on this yet.

Issues:
- Some TIMs are not actual TIMs (eg: tim-ehcache-commons) so tests could fail (maybe)
