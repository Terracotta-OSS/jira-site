## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Version : eh-cache 1.3

net.sf.ehcache.store.LfuMemoryStore$ElementMetadata calls directly Element.getKey() and not Element.getObjectKey().

The consequences are that you get a CacheException when using LFU policy with not serializable element key.

The fix for this bug would be to use getObjectKey() instead of getKey()

Hi

I have added a test to MemoryStoreTester to test each type of MemoryStore.

The issue only affected LfuMemoryStores. Thanks for reporting it.

The fix is in trunk and 1.4.
