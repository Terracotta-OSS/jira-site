Not sure if is the design, bit I don't think we should penalize someone (with an error or warning) for saying java.lang.String in the <additional-boot-jar-classes>. The check doesn't seem to be doing the right thing in this case. That class is in the boot jar, it should be throwing the IncompleteBootJarException here, no?

Fixed in rev 7482 (trunk)

BootjarTool will now emit a warning and instruction on how to fix it if a class that already belongs to the bootjar by default is listed in the <additional-boot-jar-classes/> section.

tested with trunk r7671, adding java.lang.String to tc-config.xml and ran make-boot-jar.bat. It was successful and there was no warning.

This works for when it's loading clients and the client attempts to create a bootjar, directly making the bootjar skips the test that produces the warning, i'll move the test up one level...

The check should not fail or emit a warning, for the same reason that TimEck listed above. BTW, it was a bug that we fail when something like java.lang.String is listed in the <additional-boot-jar-classes/> section. 

But we should (probably) at least warn at the time the bootjar is being created. This would be a one time notification, if a bootjar is already created, the validation shouldn't have to check and warn - otherwise, the user will receive false-negative warnings. 

So this fix will move the check at the time of bootjar creation and will now produce a warning either via the make-boot-jar or when a TC client is loaded (iff: the bootjar hasn't been created yet or still needs to be created)
