## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Would be nice to indicate to the user that tim-get.sh install command completed successully, add  the following to the output:

Done.

I don't really care what it's called, just some message that indicates success.  Installation completed.  would be fine.  Other commands like update should also get this.  It should happen whether one or many tims were updated.  

list is probably not as useful to do this for.
