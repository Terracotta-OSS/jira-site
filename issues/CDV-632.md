## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The modules-common TIM currently is just a collection of helper methods and abstract classes. We could move this to the tc-compile-api JAR and not make it a TIM.

The advantage of doing this is that we can make most TIMs and especially config-only TIM's independent of the TC version that loads them.

This task might involve modifying/updating most of the TIM's that we currently have.
