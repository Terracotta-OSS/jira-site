## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/7657.page#37256

http://terracotta.org/documentation/web-sessions/installation-guide

Documentation in above link incorrectly suggests that we support JDK 1.5 or higher.

Step 1: Requirements 

\1 JDK 1.5 or higher. 
\1 Terracotta 3.7 or higher Download the kit and run the installer on the machine that will host the Terracotta server. For use with WebSphere, you must have kit version 3.2.1\12 or higher.

I think there are a number of places where we mention JDK 1.5. I've updated the docs but will wait until a website push to resolve this jira.
