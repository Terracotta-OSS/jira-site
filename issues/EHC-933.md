## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There is a small bug in DefaultSizeOfEngine in the resource based loading of custom size-of filter rules.  Instead of using the value of the "net.sf.ehcache.sizeof.filter" system property as the resource name we use the "net.sf.ehcache.sizeof.filter" value directly.  The fix is very simple, and I have added test coverage to ensure all three forms of filter loading work correctly.
