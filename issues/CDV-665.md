## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Stats recorder panel listens for changes in the L2 stats subsystem so that when a user of another console instance changes something or starts/stops recording, the state is properly displayed.  The list of enabled stats is not currently synchronized.  There is a JMX notification for enablement, the console just isn't recognizing and responding to it.  LOE: 2 hours.
