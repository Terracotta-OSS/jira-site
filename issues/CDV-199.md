## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I execute the constructor for this class in a TerraCotta-enabled JVM, it fails to add elements. The same code works as expected on a normal JVM without TerraCotta instrumentation:

public class IntArrayMapImpl extends HashMap<Integer, Map<Integer,int[]>> {

	private int buckets = 100;

	public IntArrayMapImpl() {
		for (int i=0; i<buckets; i++) {
			put(i, new HashMap<Integer,int[]>()); // data is not added here if TC is involved
		}		
	}
}


</div>

A workaround here is to delegate to a synchronized private method in the constructor. This is a bit awkward (at least it breaks the expectations of the JMM where you don't need to synchronize during initialization):


public class IntArrayMapImpl extends HashMap<Integer, Map<Integer,int[]>> {

     private int buckets = 100; 

	public IntArrayMapImpl() {
		init();
	}

	private synchronized void init() {
		for (int i=0; i<buckets; i++) {
			put(i, new HashMap<Integer,int[]>());
		}				
	}

I think this is already fixed in 2.3 branch and trunk. 

In 2.2.1 stable 2, I don't think all of the put() calls ignored, I would think the there would be one mapping retained (99 --> HashMap())

I'll look into what was fixed in the recent branch and potentially back port the fix

I mispoke, there are to be no more 2.2.1 releases. The upcoming 2.3 release will resolve this issue

Yes, we see one mapping not 100. Thanks for the update. At least we have a workaround for 2.2
