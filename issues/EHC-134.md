## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The dependency scopes on the Maven2 POM for ehcache
1.2.2 are set in such a way that projects using
echcache inherit a lot of unnecessary jars, e.g.
hibernate, servlet, etc.

The javax.servlet dependency scope should be set to
runtime.

I'm not certain how to hide the hibernate jars.

Ok, I got most of the software build process going with maven but was a bit too 
fast and loose with my dependencies. They should be good now. 

I will fix it for 1.2.3.
