## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It would be nice to be able to set somekind of simple
cron expression when a cache element is considered expired.

This can be used to expire all elements in the midnight
etc. 3:00am

cronExpiry="0 0 3 ? \1 \1"

Will expire at 3:00 am at midnight

To start witdh we do not need as complex configurations
for setting day, month etc. Most important is the times
for specifying a certain time a day.

Maybe the cron parser code could be donated from
another open-source project:

These projects has a cron parser:
- oscache
- quartz

If you need a helping hand with some of the features I
will be able to help.

I actually use a quartz event to clear some caches periodically. That uses 
cache.removeAll().
