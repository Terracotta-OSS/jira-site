## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The chatter demo has a lot of moving parts.  It should probably not be the first sample in the list.  Also, it might be nice to see if we can streamline it a bit. The code doesn't clearly demonstrate the topics it's supposed to demonstrate.

Where is this first? Welcome app, directory? wiki? can you let us know and bounce back to drb?

Sorry, I think I meant the sample application launcher.  It looks like it's been moved later down the path.
