## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I am using EHcache 2.4.6 and test the sample code in user guide search section. 

If the cache is none transaction, it works fine. 

If the cache is "Local" transaction cache, most of the test works fine, only the "count" will return me twice the value. I also tested "sum". Same issue. I debug and found: 

in Ehcache source class AbstractTransactionStore, there is code: 
public Results executeQuery(StoreQuery query) \{ 
Results results = underlyingStore.executeQuery(query); 
if (results instanceof TxSearchResults) \{ 
// don't re-wrap needlessly 
return results; 
\} 
return new TxSearchResults(underlyingStore.executeQuery(query)); 
\} 

Why the underlyingStore.executeQuery(query) run twice in this method? After the second run, the count value is doubled. Anyone has similar issues? 

my config is like below: 
<cache name="Test" maxElementsInMemory="100000" 
eternal="false" 
overflowToDisk="false" 
transactionalMode="local"> 
<searchable keys="false" values="false"> 
<searchAttribute name="age"/> 
<!-- searchAttribute name="name" class="com.dell.wnm.services.framework.cache.EhcacheSearchPlaying$NameAttributeExtractor" /--> 
<searchAttribute name="name" expression="value.getName()"/> 
<searchAttribute name="gender" expression="value.getGender()"/> 
<searchAttribute name="state" expression="value.getAddress().getState()"/> 
</searchable> 
</cache> 

Thank you.

The fact that the query runs twice just looks like an unfortunate bug. I don't quite see however why a count() or sum() aggregation would return double the expected value. The two query executions should be independent of one another. 

Is it possible to include a complete program that demonstrates the issue? With a concrete test case we will be certain the correct bug(s) will be fixed

I also meant to ask, is this a terracotta clustered cache?

This is the test codes. I just add transaction from your example for search section in your website.

Thanks for the test code, it makes all the difference. I can see why the aggregators are getting visited twice and giving double results. 

I believe you won't hit this bug if you call end() on your query before execute()'ing it

fix should be present in ehcache-core 2.4.7, 2.5.1
