## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The transient helper dialog worked when I had a simple class like System.in in my shared graph, however when I put a Logger, it gave me 20 issues (all related to just one) which is confusing.

Furthermore, I took action (specified the logger variable to be not shared) - (incidentally, I think the action does not correlate to the config file, "not shared" is unintuitive it should be called something like mark as transient) - and after I applied the action, I was put back into the same dialog with the same set of issues.
