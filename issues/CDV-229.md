## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At present, we support trove's THashMap and THashSet. However, these classes allow for a user pluggable hashing strategy to be used. We do not maintain this aspect of the instance's state. Therefore, when a shared THashMap is materialized within an L1, it will always use the default hashing strategy.

When this item is fixed, the release notes stating that we don't support this can be updated (see DOC-199)
