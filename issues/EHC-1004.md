## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since CachingTier.clear() doesn't invoke the EvictionListeners, all entries faulted from the AuthoritativeTier won't be flushed on Store.flush() if the CacheConfiguration is set to clearOnFlush... 

The fix is probably to have the AuthoritativeTier flushAll() on Store.flush() when CacheConfiguration isClearOnFlush. Now, double checking on the semantic of this setting might be useful too...
