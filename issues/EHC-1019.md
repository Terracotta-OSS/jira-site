## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It could be an entry being flushed, once removed from the CachingTier but still in the process of being flushed within the authority, is faulted back in by another thread. 

This could lead to evicting something from the authority (and notifying listeners), while the entry could still be found in the heap tier.

</div>

The previous target was correct... only looks like I forgot to close this. 
There actually was no race, so I didn't do anything, not even closing this !

</div>
