## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This was a suggestion by Jeryl on the Solr list.  I'm adding it here for him:

Maybe you all at Terracotta could lead the implementation to  patch SOLR to allow it to use the RAMDirectory ( a setter)  so terracotta can hook into the RAMDirectory...
the way Terracotta handles clustering
