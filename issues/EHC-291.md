## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

For Ehcache interface, currently there is new service:
loadAll(java.util.Collection keys, java.lang.Object argument) 

If we want preload for this cache, and we probably don't know all the keys at the system startup time.
We may want to have new interface:
loadAll() or modify the existing loadAll service implementation to pass the null keys all the way down to the user defined CacheLoader class.

There is workaround for now though by calling:
loadAll(new Linkedlist(), null)
but looks like a hack to the Ehcache class.

Hi

Ehcache merely implements the JCACHE spec on this one. I have noted this down to add it to the JCACHE spec. When that is done we can implement it here. In the meantime I have closed this as a feature request against ehcache.
