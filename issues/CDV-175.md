## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm not even sure what we use this for, but it looks like we modified it it some way.  As part of getting stuff in order to use maven2, we should try to eliminate or get up to date with current versions of dependencies.

This should only be done AFTER we branch for 2.3.
