## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It will be nice to have a function to notify an Element 
when it is removed from Cache to be able to store its 
content in, for example, a DataBase.

When an Element is removed from Cache, a function 
like Element.willBeRemoved() should be called to notify 
the Element of its removal from Cache.
We can overload the willBeRemoved function to perform 
custom actions upon removal.

Changes:
1) MemoryStore: function 
removeLeastRecentlyUsedElement():
    When an Element is removed AND not spooled to 
disk, element.willBeRemoved should be called.
<code snip>
    if (cache.isOverflowToDisk()) {
        spoolToDisk(element);
    }
    // new part
    else {
        element.willBeRemove();
    }
</code snip>

2) Element: add function willBeRemoved()
<code snip>
    // default: do nothing, overload to perform action(s)
    public void willBeRemove() {}
</code snip>
