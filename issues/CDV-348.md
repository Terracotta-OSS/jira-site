## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment tc-config only allows explicit field names to be used in the <transient-fields> section. Given that we now allow root selection using a field expression, seems only natural to let transients to selected the same way. 

A really obvious and practical use case you be to make all logger instances transient by matching on the field type.
