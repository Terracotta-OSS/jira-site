## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I would like to add JNDI lookup of the remote 
CacheEventListener instead of RMI lookup.  I 
investigated the RMI implementation to see if it 
could be extended for JNDI.  Here are some 
limitations.

RMICacheManagerPeerProvider method 
lookupRemoteCachePeer should not be static so that it 
can be overridden.

To extend RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory, method 
createManuallyConfiguredCachePeerProvider should be 
protected, or there could be a configuration property 
to provide the class name of the 
CacheManagerPeerProvider to construct.

RMICacheManagerPeerListener methods init and dispose 
need to be protected.

RMICacheReplicatorFactory private methods should be 
protected.
