## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Our forge monkey sends an e-mail out to project owners when there is a build or test failure for a project.  This e-mail contains a link to the logs and archives for the build to help debug the problem.  However, these links are not usable by external contributors since they refer to file servers private to the terracotta internal network.

We need to find a way for external contributors to access the logs and archives of failed builds.  Consider S3 or an internet-facing file store.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

As I talked with Dave about exposing Forge monkey logs to outsiders
(committers) on .org site, he can sync the logs on kong to .org every
hour or so.

Directory to be synched: /shares/monkeyoutput/archive/forge

I'll have the Forge monkeys emails to have both links, 1 to kong as is,
1 to the mirror on .org.

IT ticket #1596
