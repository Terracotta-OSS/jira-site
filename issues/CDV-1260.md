## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

A class which extends java.lang.Thread encountered an assertion error when trying to access an instance of LinkedBlockingQueue.

The error message "com.tc.util.TCAssertionError: object was not null" is no help in determining the source of the error.

The work-around for the problem is to not extend Thread, but instead to implement Runnable, please see the discussion thread:

This is a clone of CDV-1262 with a different proposed action.  Once CDV-1262 is fixed this should not be a problem when overriding the thread class.

Walter has fixed this in CDV-1262, and has also filed DOC-614 for the documentation issue regarding the results of overriding the getId method of Thread.
