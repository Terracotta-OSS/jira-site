## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Attached is a sample showing the problem. Without DSO, the type of the clone is Test$MyList. When DSO instruments this class, clone() ends up getting called on the delegate which is of type ArrayList

Linked CDV-391 as a possibly related issue, but not sure.

Need to uncomment the call call to testSubClass() in HashtableCloneTestApp.runTest() after fixing this.

Hi, 

I have attached the instrumented version of this class. In this class i can see clone method as follows

	public Object clone() {
	    return \1\1tc\1get\1\1delegate\1tc\1java\1util\1ArrayList().clone();
	}

A call to clone on MyList turns into a call to ArrayList.clone() and hence the Assertion error.

Possible solution :
1. We do not add this method while instrumenting the class (this will delegate the call of clone() to its parent).
2. We add this method in the instrmented class but just call super.clone(), instead of \1\1tc\1get\1\1delegate\1tc\1java\1util\1ArrayList().clone().

Alex thinks this might be a workaround:

I believe if you avoid calling super.clone() and just build the object  
yourself, that would work:

public Object clone() {
	SegmentInfos a = new SegmentInfos();
	// set fields of a
	return a;
}


Also, it looks like SegmentInfos.clone() probably makes a deep clone  
of the SegmentInfo objects it holds, so you'd need to do that as  
well.  I don't think you'd have any problems there calling  
SegmentInfo.clone().

The problem arises in this case due to a combination of the logical  
instrumentation of Vector and the call to native clone(), which makes  
instrumentation more challenging.

Unlinked CDV-391, as they have different causes.
