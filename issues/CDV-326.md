Geert/Eugene did all the work for this one -- thanks!

We don't necessary have a way to export to a particular loader, rather a way to export any classloader that happens to ask for an exported class. It's possible this might be problematic, but I haven't seen a case yet. If need be, we could mix classloader name into the export mechanism, but that needs some thought and could hurt when/if we try to move away from named loaders
