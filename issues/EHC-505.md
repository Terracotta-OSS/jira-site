## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In DX, the probe is getting the credentials required to connect from the Monitor Server. These are propagated during the handshake... Currently a probe exposes all its functionalities without any credentials required, until it registers with the Monitor...
We could have a probe refusing connection until it got registered with a master properly (and maybe got credentials, or not, by then)

per DEV-4358, there's no longer authentication between probe and monitor so this issue no longer applied
