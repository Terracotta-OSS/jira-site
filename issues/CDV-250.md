## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This may not be a bug, but I think it's worth investigating....

I noticed in the most recent builds of the product that moving an object in the sharededitor results in activity in the object fault rate (if there is at least more than one L1).

Introspecting the Shape object shows that the fields are Double.  I would not have expected changes to Doubles to result in object fault.  In the app are new Doubles created when moving the object around or is the value updated?  Either way I thought we treated Doubles as literals and would therefore not have expected to see the fault rate move.
