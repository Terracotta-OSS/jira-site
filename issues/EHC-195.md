## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

found in MulticastRMICacheManagerPeerProvider:

    /\1\1
     \1 One second, in ms
     \1/
    protected static final int SHORT\1DELAY = 100;

Either the documentation or the value is wrong.

ms == milli-seconds -> 1000ms == 1s

If it's a real bug it is prolly very well hidden, because it would work this way, too, just 10 times faster :)

That's the main reason to report it, don't want to be nitpicking. If it's only the documentation, just update it please. It's confusing the way it is.
