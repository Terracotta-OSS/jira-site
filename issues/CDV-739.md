## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It isn't well known, but autolocking a method that does something like:

String s = "bob";
syncrhonized(s) {
  //
} 

will obtain dso lock based on the value (not the identity) of the String. It doesn't matter if the String instance has been referred to by a shared object or not. This feature is known as literal autolocks. 

The suprising thing (provided literal autolocks aren't surprising enough) is that wait/notify() on the String instance does not do anything (it is local only)

Yeah thanks tim.  I  forgot about this feature.  Nice.  We need to make a corollary doc bug to make sure this gets documented.
