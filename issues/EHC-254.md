## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Would it be possible to add some public setters for
some Cache properties, such as maxElementsInMemory,
TTL, TTI?

We would like to have these setters to adjust the cache
setting thru an admin interface.

This cache Configuration gets parsed at set up during the initalization stage. 

It is a bit too big of a change to implement that right now.

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
