## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Server logging verbiage:

org.terracotta.ehcachedx.dashboard.DashboardPeerListenerFactory -> ??? I am not sure about class names. How about: org.terracotta.ehcachedx.monitor.probePeerListenerFactory agree. Let's remove all references to Dashboard as this is confusing.

dashboardName -> probeName
dashboardAddress -> probeAddress
dashboardPort -> probePort
dashboardMasterAddress -> serverAddress should be monitorAddress 
dashboardMasterPort -> serverPort should be monitorPort
dashboardLicenseFile -> ... this would go away if the license can be served centrally. should be removed.
