## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Though peerUrls is created using Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap()), compound operations are not thread-safe. Dont think its a big issue though, at worst it will create multiple copies of same (with different dates possibly) CachePeer and the last thread will win in putting it in the map.
Should probably synchronize on peerUrls.
