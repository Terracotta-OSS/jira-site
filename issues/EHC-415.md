## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Got following error while testing ohsm test with ehcache 1.7.0. We are creating cache programmatically in the test.

Caused by: net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: no terracotta configuration has been initalized for this cache manager
                at net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.createTerracottaStore(CacheManager.java:323)
                at net.sf.ehcache.Cache.initialise(Cache.java:694)
                at net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.addCacheNoCheck(CacheManager.java:784)
                at net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.addCache(CacheManager.java:774)
                at net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.addCache(CacheManager.java:752)


As per Geert, "there seems to be a bug wrt to the config stuff from what I read, you need to have a terracotta clustered cache in the ehcache configuration file for the store to be created. if you don't and add a TC clustered cache programmatically then the clustered memory store isn't initialized for that since so maybe just add a dummy cache to the ehcache.xml file that is clustered".

Fixed. Also fixed a bug as bonus for this :), throw exception when user is running without standalone jar, with tim jars and running without tc.

Verified in rev 

product-name    = Ehcache Core
version         = 1.7.1
built-by        = cruise
build-jdk       = 1.6.0\_17
build-time      = 2009-11-30 02:20:28
build-revision  = 1471

ehcache-core-1.7.0.jar is throwing the exception while ehcache-core-1.7.1.jar works fine.

Another issue related to this problem is that your SampledCacheManager MBeans won't be registered so there will be no content in the DevConsole panel.

What is the issue? The Dev Console?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The issue currently is that the MBean isn't properly registered under certain circumstances making the panel not appear in the DevConsole.  The problem, as Gert describes it, was partially fixed, but not the MBean registration part.

We get ehcache panel in dev-console for programmatically create caches too.

Verified in 
```
