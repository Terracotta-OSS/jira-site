## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

 SVT once it does the convertion from CSV to H2 database, it writes it in some temp location. But there is no way to zip that and reuse that. Everytime you want to analyze the data, it always wants it in CSV format and takes a looong time to convert it again and again. It will be nice if we can just zip the converted database and then work with that from then on. If we fix CDV-974 this is not an issue.

Decision required on whether we want to do this or not, and if yes, when?
