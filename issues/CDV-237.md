## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums:

If I mistype the field-name of a root declaration in my terracotta config, running the application does not throw any error whatsoever. I tried enabled root debugging in the config, but it still doesn't say anything about incorrectly named roots. Is there a way to have terracotta output these errors to the log?

---

This is a bit tricky. Since java dynamically loads it's classes the question is at what point does a root definition become invalid? One could even be dynamically generating the class with the root. The way I currently deal with this kind of thing is to turn on debugging and if the root isn't getting created I go back and validate my config. 

That said, we might be able to have some sort of validator that searches the classpath for all roots and gives a warning if no variable matches the root spec. While not perfect because of dynamically generated stuff I think it would be helpful 99 percent of the time.

Another idea:

If a class is loaded that matches the package and classname, but the field specifies a field that does not exist, print a warning.

Or maybe have a functionality to list all the roots that are in the config but that aren't currently in use, this could help to detect config problems. Spitting out a bunch of warnings that can happen with dynamically loaded classes that are not necessarily in the classpath could generate more noise that is actually useful. I'm generally not a real fan of logging warnings.

RMP-213 is added to follow up on Geert's idea. but in the short term follow Taylor's plan

The implementation to resolve this issue does not check if a root is declared as an expression.
Tell me if you would like to support that as well.

I tried to trigger this condition.

It's pretty simple, I used both of the helloclusteredxxx projects listed here:

http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Recipe?recipe=helloclusteredworld
http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Recipe?recipe=helloclusteredinstance

In both cases, I modified the tc-config.xml to delete one letter from the root definition, making it invalid.

Then I ran the demos as instructed on the site.

I did not receive any warning or info messages indicating the invalid root specification on either the console or in the client logs.

Can you validate that the behaviour is as expected?

edit the tc-config.xml, changing to
        <root>
          <field-name>Main.counte</field-name>
        </root>

run the sample, client output:

Can you re-run this test in 3.0.0 and update the comments?
The 2.7.3 are correct.

CDV-1249 is a related issue

Taylor thinks it might work for non-literal roots and not for literal roots. Can you check that?

Also, the behavior is the same for int and Integer. Warning is emitted only if an instrumented-classes stanza is added to tc-config.

From Nadeem
Basically for each release I tried two cases:

first, just edited tc-config.xml to typo the root defn, no warning next, leaving the typo in the root defn, add a instrumented-classes stanza to tc-config, now see the warning

And then tried it with the int, as the cookbook has it, and again after modifying to Integer. - No warning
