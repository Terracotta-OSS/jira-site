## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm trying to set up a cache using the following configuration: 

<cache name="testCache" maxElementsInMemory="5" maxElementsOnDisk="5" eternal="true" overflowToDisk="false" memoryStoreEvictionPolicy="LRU" diskPersistent="true" />

The idea is that the cache does not overflow to disk during runtime but is persisted when the JVM exits. However, with the current version of ehcache my testCache is never persisted. 

Therefore i started debugging into the source code and noticed that the Cache.dispose() methode, which is called by CacheManager.shutdown() contains the following code:

public synchronized void dispose() throws IllegalStateException {
   checkStatusNotDisposed();

   if (executorService != null) {
     executorService.shutdown();
   }
   disposeRegisteredCacheExtensions();
   registeredEventListeners.dispose();

   if (memoryStore != null) {
     memoryStore.dispose();
   }
   memoryStore = null;
   if (configuration.isOverflowToDisk() && diskStore != null) {
     diskStore.dispose();
     diskStore = null;
   }
   changeStatus(Status.STATUS\1SHUTDOWN);
}


if i interpret this code correctly the diskStore.dispose() method is only called if the overflowToDisk parameter is set to true. However, in my opinion this code should be 

 if (configuration.isDiskPersistent() && diskStore != null)

then the diskStore.dispose() would be called if the diskPersistent is set to true.
