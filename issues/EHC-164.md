## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The shutdown hook can be disabled in the latest version, but I believe it shouldn't be enabled by default at first.

I have three applications, one tomcat webapp, one custom server running as a windows service and the same server running from command line in tests. In each of these cases I have to explicitly disable the ehcache shutdown hook.

Shutting down the cache is the task of its owner, and ehcahce shouldn't interfere with the correct shutdown sequence which it doesn't know. I cannot imagine any situation when this feature is useful, except when you have no control on the shutdown sequence in a badly designed server framework - but that is not a good reason to enable this feature for everybody.

If there is some other reason unknown for me, then please at least move this option into the ehcache configuration file from the command line. The configuration file comes with the application so there would be no need to give the option everytime and everywhere when the app is started or to create batch files only for this purpose.
