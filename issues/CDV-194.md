## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Adding names locks into classes used as part of the mechanics of class loading (Vector, LinkedList, etc) doesn't play nice with DSO startup. The workaround is not use named locks at such a low level (which is REALLY bad idea anyway). The locks in question can ALWAYS be put higher in the call stack (ie. in the methods invoking the operations on the LinkedList, Vector, etc). 

It might be possible to make this construct work, but maybe not. This item is a placeholder to look into the issue furtther
