## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a situation where several key may refer the same
object.

Like ehcache does not suport this feature, the same
object will be stored for each key (n instances of the
same object, where n is the number of diferent keys
that that object may be refered from).

At some point i have the knowledge to calculate the
other keys, but not before i need them.

Situation :

   GEN KEY (1)
   Check if object is in cache (2)
      TRUE : Retreve it

      FALSE : Process the new object (3)
                    Place it in ehcache
   return OBJECT

At point (1) just know one of the keys. At the point
(3) there is the possibility to know all keys that the
object may have associated to it in ehcache.
The problem is that the keys are needed at point (2).

That is, to associate to one key only must know the
object it self (the one that is in cache). When adding
the object i know the other keys so, the knowledge to
refer the same object to the several keys is possible.

There is a product called jofti that solves this problem. It works with ehcache.
