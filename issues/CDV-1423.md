## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The connected clients in the developer console are identified with ip and port. In the Connect Clients table also the live objects and the ClientID is listed.
If there is more than one client JVM running on a host it's really difficult to identify the JVM only with the port or the clientid.

It would be very helpful to display a "name" for example the "tc.node-name" property in the console (can also be a new property or we can set the clientid).
This client-name should be displayed in the table and in the topology tree (for example: ip:port - "client-name")

Is this easy?

I don't think this is a good idea because system properties are scoped to the JVM while we allow multiple L1's per JVM.  The problem of how to name L1s isn't new but we just haven't tried hard to find the correct answer yet.
