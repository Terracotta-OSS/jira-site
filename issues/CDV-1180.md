## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The LiteralValues class is a big collection of int constants and switch statements.  It is subject to change over time depending on what types are handled as literals.  When it changes, code in several different other classes is affected, so it has a comment:

   \* NOTE:: READ THIS IF YOU ARE ADDING NEW TYPES TO THIS FILE. XXX:: If you are adding more types, please see
   \* PhysicalStateClassLoader and DNAEncoding. You need to be adding New code in both those classes or else some things
   \* will be broken.

Now that we can use Java 5 features, this class seems like a good candidate for conversion to an enum.  At the same time we do that, we should also consider changing the way it is used: at present, the class is separately and privately instantiated by more than a dozen clients, even though it has no mutable data and could just be static.
