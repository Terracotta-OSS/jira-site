## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

org.terracotta.agent.loader.Jar.lookup(String) fails to close input streams. This has the side effect of retaining pooled inflator instances in the truezip library. The amount of memory wasted is bounded, but it seems to take about 27MB of heap. 

org.terracotta.agent.Agent includes the agent jar in search path for the loader that creates the class transformer. This is done solely to pick up one class (org.terracotta.agent.Agent.Boot). The agent jar is large though (~12MB) and will be in memory.

ran h2lcperf with hibernate standalone

java -Xmx40m -Dcom.tc.productkey.path=product.key -javaagent:hibernate\terracotta-hibernate-agent-ee-1.0.0.jar -cp h2lcperf\\1; org.terracotta.petclinic.perftest.PetClinicPerfTest mvn-tc-run.node.properties

It used to fail with such less max heap. It starts up with 3.1.0-ee
