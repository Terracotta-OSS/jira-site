## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Windows start script for Tomcat 6 in the Session Configurator is incorrect and doesn't pass the project.name system property.  This results in application events not being generated.

Please look into this for Pacheco final (but don't check anything into 2.6 branch until it opens up:)

Retested with Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev8504, as of 20080512-160535 (Revision 8504 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.6), it is working as expected.
