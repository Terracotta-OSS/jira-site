## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The code that sets up the standalone L1 instance is \1highly\1 duplicated between standalone ehcache and standalone hibernate. This item is to remove that redundancy so that we don't end up with bugs fixed in one place and not the either. 

It will necessarily create some more forge modules to host the common bits
