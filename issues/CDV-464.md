## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

dso-env.sh -q does not set the needed system variables JAVA\_OPTS and TC\_JAVA\_OPTS, and the former is needed by the tomcat client.

Tested under Debian Linux.
 
The workaround is to set the needed vars by yourself, but then you have to be careful that JAVA\_OPTS is not set when you're starting the server, else the server won't start.

Boyan 
we have been unable to reproduce the issue you are seeing with the scripts. Can you verify if bin/sh is the default shell on your system?  If it is can you change to bin/bash?
regards
Fiona
