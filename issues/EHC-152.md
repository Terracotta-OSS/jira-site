## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

FindBugs 1.2.0-dev finds a "High Priority Correctness" Bug in ehcache 1.2.4:

The method update(final Object key) of UpdatingSelfPopulatingCache passes a known null value of the local variable element to the method refreshElement of SelfPopulatingCache.

The local variable element is known null at line 103 and 104, but the variable is passed at line 108 to refreshElement of SelfPopulatingCache which leads to a NPE at line 196 (Object key = element.getObjectKey();).

I agree the logging method looks a bit strange. I have added a return to the null guard to clean it up. It is not however a bug. The calling method get(final Object key) checks for null and only calls update if the key is non-null. I have added a null test to UpdatingSelfPopulatingCacheTest#testFetchAndUpdate

I see that you are a committer to OSCache. Your bug reports, patches and other contributions are most welcome.
