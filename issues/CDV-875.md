## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The ID generator for TC sessions does not guarantee that a unique session ID will be created for new sessions. DefaultIDGenerator uses a SecureRandom and a local only counter, but that only makes the chances for a collision very small, it does not ensure there not be a collision. The ID generator will need to cooperate with the data store to ensure that key does not exist before allowing to be issued to a request for a new session

The problem gets worse when multiple contexts are clustered that all have the same context path (but differing vhosts) (see CDV-206) since the root for the session data store will be come to common to all of those contexts.

We should also change the ID generator to use more characters. There is no reason we can't use the entire range A-Z,a-z,0-9 in the ID. The key space would be much larger in this case. Right now all we use is A-F,0-9
