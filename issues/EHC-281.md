## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There might be a small problem in the
MulticastReceiverThread class
(MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatReceiver.java, Rev. 52,
line 132). The self(String rmiUrl) method checks
whether the incoming URL is matching the first entry in
the list of cache peers (which is - I guess - it's own
address). This works if two Java processes run on
different machines (with different IP addresses). 

When using two Java processes that want to share the
cache on the same machine, this check does not work,
because both VMs have the same IP address and
multicast-port. In my scenario, both processes use the
same configuration file, but as far as I understand the
configuration settings, I think this is not a problem.

To solve this issue (if it is one ;), I would propose
to use a (semu-)unique ID that every cache manager
creates at startup and uses it until it is terminated.
This ID could be added to the payload that is sent to
the other peers. (e.g., the URL could instead of
//192.168.6.73:40001/SESSIONS look like
//192.168.6.73:40001/SESSIONS;id=<xxx> or
//192.168.6.73:40001/SESSIONS/<xxx>).

Hope that helps,
Roman
