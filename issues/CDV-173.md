## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

abstract class A extends HashSet; 
class B extends A

If B is included for instrumentation, you'll be rewarded with a java.lang.InstantiationError

Some actual sample code that produces the issue:

  private static abstract class AbstractSub extends HashSet \{
    public abstract String abstractMethod();
  \}


  private static class SubclassOfAbstractLogicalSubclass extends AbstractSub \{
    final String s = "sdkfj";

    public String abstractMethod() {
      return s;
    }
  \}


</div>

Best I can tell from the instrumentation, we're trying to new up an instance of the abstract super class to use as the delegate

I am wondering why we instrument B to delegate calls  ? If we have a delegate in A and make sure every public and protected methods are delegated to it, B should work like any other physical object that extends another class, no ?

I think the problem here is that A, which is a direct subclass of HashSet, has no field. So, the instrumentation treat it as a regular logical class. B, which is a subclass of A, has a field in it. So, the instrumentation tries to create a delegate field of type A, and it fails because A is an abstract class.
