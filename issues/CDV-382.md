For the time being, I am making the SessionFactory.close() method an no-op.

Please let me know if there is any concerns/issues.

This jira issue says there is a workaround but does not describe what it is. Does anyone know what the workaround is?

The SessionFactory.close() calls org.hibernate.cache.EhCache.destroy() which removes a cache and calls org.hibernate.cache.EhCacheProvider.stop() which shutdowns the CacheManager.

For the time being, we are making these 2 methods an no-op when hibernate with ehcache as 2nd level cache running in a clustered mode.
