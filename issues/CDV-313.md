## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment you cannot share an instance of java.lang.reflect.Field (or Method, Constructor, etc). It wouldn't take much work to support these guys. By itself, the use case for sharing reflection objects seems kinda silly, but it's not unreasonable that some other higher level object might have references to things like this. If they just worked out of the box, the world would be a better place.

This originally came up at a customer site where they were trying to share and instance of org.apache.commons.beanutils.BasicDynaClass as part of DSO session enabled web app
