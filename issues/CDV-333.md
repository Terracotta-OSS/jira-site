## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is now targeted for a post G 2.0 release, when the new admin interface features in are (newer version of pluto being used, allows for dynamic portlet deployment), and we will possibly have some sort of administrative hooks to set up the JAVA\_OPTS and other environment variables.

Research now will focus on the G sandbox "portlets" and "gbean" code lines, which will be integrated into trunk after a 2.0 branch is cut.

Baby has taken his first steps!  Using maven2 you can build a valid JAR (car) that is a Geronimo 1.1[.1] service, which can be installed, started, stopped, restarted and uninstalled.  Additionally, via the JMX interface you can invoke the four "Terracotta" management operations: install, enable, disable and uninstall.

None of these operations or lifecycle events actually does anything at this point except print out that such operations/events are being triggered.

Next step is to integrate the Terracotta GBean with the web-based Geronimo administration console.

Marking this resolved as JeffG has finished. Hung is testing and ran into issues. See the linked INT issue.
