## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

OS: Windows XP
Maven: 2.0.10

I have set up an environment variable that I would like to use inside ehcache.xml (as is said possible in the commented sample ehcache.xml shipped with Terracotta, located in <installdir>/ehcache).
The environment variable is set to: C:\dev\paysol
In the following attribute I would like to use it:
<terracottaConfig url="${PROJECT\1DIR}/core/terracotta/tc-config.xml"/>
But when I build our project from the command line I get the following error:
2010-09-02 17:23:33,640 ERROR - Could not fetch configuration data from the file at 'C:\dev\paysol\core\ejb\.\${PROJECT\1DIR}\core\terracotta\tc-config.xml'.
As you can see from the output the environment variable has not been replaced with its actual value as supposed to and has also been concatenated with another path for some reason.

As a quick reference to what is said in the comment located in the beginning in the sample ehcache.xml I'm pasting it here:
"System property tokens can be specified in this file which are replaced when the configuration
is loaded. For example multicastGroupPort=${multicastGroupPort} can be replaced with the
System property either from an environment variable or a system property specified with a
command line switch such as -DmulticastGroupPort=4446."
