## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm using ehcache as hibernate 2nd level cache. Currently for all of the entities >50 a disk-expire-thread is acquired, which effectivly do nothing the whole time, but consuming valuable system-resources.

This issue has Fix version marked as 2.0.0 but I can't find the relevant change anywhere in the codebase (checking version 2.1.0) - has this been incorporated?

This was originally targeted for 2.0 but has been rescheduled to a future release.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Any plans regarding this? We use a huge number of DiskStore-backed caches and EhCache spawns a thread per cache that does basically nothing most of the time. This consumes resources (OS threads and stack memory for each thread, which defaults to 1 MB in 64 bit JVMs, though can be tuned with Xss JVM parameter).
