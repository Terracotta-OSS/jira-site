## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, if you try to run >1 L1 from same location without pointing them to different stats dirs, you will see a message suggesting that you start each node with a tc.node-name property and differentiate the stats dirs in tc-config.xml using %(tc.node-name).  

The issue with this is that it doesn't work without modifying your command line and tc-config.xml to match.  There have been some suggestions or possibilities mentioned on tc-dev:
1) Name directories differently automatically (perhaps by default with allowed override if specified)
2) Have standard node name property so suggestion could be simpler
3) Use in-memory mode by default and have no directory
4) Key off the log directory settings

Need to discuss further and decide on a direction.
