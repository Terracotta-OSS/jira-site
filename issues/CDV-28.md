## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

- 
Need a mechanism to replicate changes from a sub-cluster local to a data-center to other data-centers (for hedging against data-center as a failure point). 
-
Need a mechanism to identify and event on conflicts and allow a pluggable (and even a default) conflict resolution mechanism.

</div>
