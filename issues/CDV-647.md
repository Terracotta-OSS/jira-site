## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

See screenshot - the download fails with an S3 error.  Can we double check this maybe it is a transient S3 error, or maybe something went wrong in the publish process?

I have added logging for uploading script so we would be able to tell what went wrong during that phase next time.
For now, I've pushed a new nightly.
