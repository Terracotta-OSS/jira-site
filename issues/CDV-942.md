## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It would be very useful to have following implemented.

Changes to the log level can be made via JMX for both the L1 and L2
 A control should be added to the Admin Console to enable this ability for the Server and each connectedclient
The current log level should be visible as a property or some other obvious form in the Admin Console for both the Server and client

Admin console should be able to change the different logging available in tc @ runtime like

l2.cachemanager.logging.enabled
l2.transactionmanager.logging.enabled
l2.transactionmanager.logging.verbose
l2.transactionmanager.logging.printStats
l2.transactionmanager.logging.printCommits
l2.objectmanager.fault.logging.enabled
l2.objectmanager.persistor.logging.enabled

and many more.
