## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The state object for ConcurrentHashMap does not know how to write differential updates to the disk store. This means that the entire state of the map is written to disk when changes are applied to it. 

This is especially problematic when the map is very large and/or contains large literal (ie. String) keys/values.

This is a pretty scary bug. We pitch ConcurrentHashMap all over the place. If the fix isn't too hard we need to do it in the 2.5 line.
