## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

<web-application> tag now has an optional attribute:  <web-application synchronous-write="true">
Currently the configurator will run fine if this attribute is set by modifying the tc-config.xml directly.  We need to make it posible to set this attribute through the configurator.   

</div>
