## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The following servlet gives an error on appEngine, in production mode (works fine in development mode)

@SuppressWarnings("serial")
public class TestServlet extends HttpServlet \{
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp)
			throws IOException \{
		
		long l = net.sf.ehcache.util.Timestamper.next();
		
		resp.setContentType("text/plain");
		resp.getWriter().println("Hello, world " + l);
	\}
\}

The problem lies in VicariousThreadLocal using an AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater which is not really supported by GAE

There is this monkey job: http://jenkinsmaster.terracotta.lan:9000/job/googleappengine-ehcache-check/, not sure who maintains that test...

Nobody really "owns" GAE afaik. But Dev will fix something if it needs to be attended to.

HI Dotan
My comment was intended for our Development team and QA Team. Although that was not clear. 

EHC-617 was a problem not with Ehcache but with Google App Engine itself. 
We will prioritise and assign this issue within  the next couple of days.
Regards
Fiona
