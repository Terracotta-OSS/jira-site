## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently probes need their own license file (and probeLicenseFile property in listener config).  Would be better if they could obtain their license from the monitor server and have a single file to deal with.

Verified in rev 5239

LRT covers this. License file path is given to Dx Server only. Probes get the correct license from the server connected to.
