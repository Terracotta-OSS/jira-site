## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We seem to get a lot of forum traffic about sessions not working correctly, and some of the big questions seem to be 'is my configuration correct?  do I have the right web-app names?'

We should add some very basic customer logging about every web application that is or is not instrumented for use with Terracotta Sessions.
