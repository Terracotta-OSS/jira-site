## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

[ehcache-1.7.1.pom|http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache/1.7.1/ehcache-1.7.1.pom] contains reference to external (non maven central) repository, thus not adhering to the rules for deploying artifacts to maven central repository (see "FAQ and common mistakes" in official ["Guide to uploading artifacts to the Central Repository"|http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-central-repository-upload.html]).

The repositories mentioned are only used for building snapshots, because central does not provide a snapshot repository feature.

 It is not required for normal building or use.

We could strip those out before publishing to central, as a release step.

Greg, your first comment was a while ago, but for future googlers: 
You should not strip out the repository tag as a release step (if done wrong would violate your checksum).  The <repositories> element should be removed.  All that is needed is the distributionManagement element.
