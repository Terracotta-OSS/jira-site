## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

No version number for Ehcache is included in the manifest, or one of the class files. If the Jar file is renamed as Ehcache it makes it difficult to identify the version number of ehcache (eg. 1.3.0).
Apache projects have the version in the manifest
