## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Seems that a hard dependency on SLF4J for logging has been added to Ehcache core. This for instance makes the Ehcache DX kit incomplete since the SLF4J jars are missing.

D'oh just saw the slf4j API jar is in there, but no implementation jar.

I thought the SLF4J stuff was happening in a branch?

I'd say this is actually not an issue with ehcache-dx, but rather with core due to the addition of slf4j.  slf4j requires some logging implementation jar to be added to it to pick its logging config and since we aren't shipping with one, a user w/o a logging jar already has to deal with that.  

I think we should ship the core (and ehcache-terracotta and dx by extension) kits with at least one slf4j log impl jar and maybe more than one to cover the common cases.  

Assigning to greg to handle that issue.
