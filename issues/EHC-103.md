## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I am not sure if this is bug but when I start the 
simple program with configuration the same as 
described in documentation I get weird exception.

My program in simple java class with main method :

CacheManager manager = CacheManager.create();

My classpath :

encache-1.2beta3.jar
commons required libs as described in docs and also 
Hibernate and all of its dependencies because 
documentation does not clearly states if 
Hibernate+depend are needed in simple standalone 
scenario

Exception I get :

[CLOVER] FATAL ERROR: Clover could not be 
initialised. Are you sure you have Clover in the 
runtime classpath? (class 
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:com\_cenqua\_clover/Clove
rVersionInfo)
Exception in thread "main" 
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com\_cenqua\_clover/g

This has already been reported and closed. The fix is in
trunk. It will be out in the beta 4 in the next few days.
