## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

tim-jmx: thisNodeConnected() is not called when the L1 initially connects. As a workaround, users can use waitForRegistration() + getMyNodeId(), but it seems like it would be easier to just call thisNodeConnected(Object arg0) at registration (does not need to be right at registration, but as early as possible). It would also allow the api to follow the principle of least surprise (most people would expect to get a call to thisNodeConnected() for the initial connection).

This api will be deprecated in Quintara, making this bug obsolete.
