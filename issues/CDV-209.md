## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The administrator console is attempting to contact the Terracotta server within the Swing EDT.  If there are timeout issues (such as network errors, firewall issues, etc), the console 'wedges' until the timeout happens.  If the user switches away fromthe console and comes back, the EDT is unable to refresh the envrionment, and you get a 'grey box' (basically a locked thread).  

Connections to the server should happen in a SwingWorker thread so the adminclient will update with the status of what it's doing, and not fail to respond to GUI events.

Admin console also locks up when looking up roots from a tc server dealing with a lot load (e.g., TIMS test).  It would be ideal if admin console can display itself without blocking on object lookup and inform users of its status.  Also, it would be nice to give users a way to cancel such process that may take a very long time to complete.
