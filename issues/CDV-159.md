## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

the tc.dumphierarchy=true system property is invaluable to identify wht to mark as transient upon encountering a non portable exception. However in certain cases, it does not dump the object graph traversal making it quite hard to guess what needs to be transient.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

this feature (in it's 2.2.1 form) has been removed for Moraga. The constraints and limitations of the previous version should be gone. Don't see too much value in hacking in 2.2.1
