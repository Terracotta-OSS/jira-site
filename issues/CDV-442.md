## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums, http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/479.page

AsmClassInfo prints a warning when a class cannot be loaded as a stream resource. For generated classes, there may be no .class resource available, or in the case of hivemind, the classloader might just have a bug in it. 

This item is to look into whether we should have a fallback to JavaClassInfo in some places, and also to look into whether ASMClassInfo should be remembering that a resource cannot be loaded through a particular loader.

AsmClassInfo(line 734)
        System.out.println(
                "AW::WARNING - could not load class ["
                        + componentName
                        + "] as a resource in loader ["
                        + loader
                        + "]"
        );

revision 5963 has some changes that will at least only make this get printed once per missing resource. Made a small, but measurable speedup for the sample tapestry app in question
