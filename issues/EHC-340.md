## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Description:
----------------
Ehcache currently supports only Least Recently Used
(LRU) policy for the memory store. The proposed patch
has the implementations for for the First In First Out
(FIFO) and the Least Frequently Used (LFU) policies.

The new classes can be tested programmatically. The
patch also consists of the corresponding test classes
for both FIFO and LFU.

The changes warrant some minor changes in the design.
This caused the changes to MemoryStore and Cache
classes. The modified classes are also provided in the
patch


New classes:
------------------
1. AbstractMemoryStore
2. FifoMemoryStore
3. LfuMemoryStore
4. FifoMemoryStoreTest
5. LfuMemoryStoreTest

Modified classes:
-----------------------
1. Cache
2. MemoryStore

ToDo:
--------
Currently, the new policies can only be tested
programmatically. A new attribute "memoryStorePolicy"
is to be added to the "Cache" element in the
ehcache.xml, and have to make necessary changes in the
code to read the attribute.
