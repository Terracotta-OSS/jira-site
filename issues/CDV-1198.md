## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

the current tc-properties section of the ref (docs) tc-config.xml file shows this:

 <tc-properties>
        <!-- This section defines the tuning properties of terracotta cluster
                These properties are called tc-properties and user can provide
                them here too in addition to the local tc.properties file

                The order in which the properties would be overridden is the following
                        tc-properties from the installation jar
                        tc-properties from the tc-config
                        tc-properties from local tc.properties file
                        tc-properties set via system properties
        -->
  </tc-properties>

Demonstrate the format of the property element.

Here's an example (with some real properties):

     <tc-properties>
         <property name="session.cookie.domain" value=".abc.com" />
         <property name="session.cookie.name" value="FOOCOOKIE " />
     </tc-properties>
