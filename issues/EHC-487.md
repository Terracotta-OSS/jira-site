## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Cache Manager tab shows activity with "Hit Rate Miss Rate Put Rate". Replace with a graphic such as a horizontal bar chart that changes, like the signal on a stereo showing the loudness of the signal. I don't like reporting these stats for the Cache Manager as it says nothing about the effectiveness of each cache.

The key observation here is that people shouldn't expect to tune the cachemanager - but rather the cache. the cache manager summary stats server purely to show relative activity

Despite my concerns, aggregating stats by CacheManager does not seem to have caused any problems.
