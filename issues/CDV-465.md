## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When JAVA\1OPTS is set with a TC bootjar argument (for instance by using dso-env), and the server is started up, the server never starts up and prints the following warnings:

WARN - Connection refused from server: 127.0.0.1:9510

I assume that when the bootjar is present when the server is started, the TC-instrumented Java classes try to contact a server during server startup. Since this startup isn't finished yet, the above warning message is displayed. When the bootjar is not present, his TC server started without a problem.

I think we should add a check as early as possible to the server startup logic, to make sure that users haven't activated the bootjar for the server and to tell them what to do in case it is present. Otherwise, a problem like this can be very discouraging and most probably turn off people that are trying Terracotta out.
