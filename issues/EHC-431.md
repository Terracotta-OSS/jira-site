## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">


CacheResource, CachesResource, ElementResource depend about Jersey REST api 

we could change it to just depend about just JSR-311 JAX-RS 

The jersey dependency is focus about NotFoundException and ConflitException
we coud change by new WebApplicationException(code)
This class comes from jax-rs api

I will test this change into my projet and will provide a patch asap

Best

Happy to review this patch. Now that 311 is out and there are multiple high quality implementations this makes sense.

You will need to complete a contributor agreement. You can find the form here: http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/devdocs/How+To+Become+A+Contributor

Let me know when you have sent it in.
