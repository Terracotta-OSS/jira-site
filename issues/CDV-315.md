This work should be done in a private branch. And may at some time be merged to 2.4 for a dot release.

This needs to be done before Ortega, so should be worked on as discussed in a private branch and merged to 2.4. We will most likely do a 2.4.3 with just this new feature, it is a customer requirement.

Steve told me this was for 2.4.2, so I moved it there

With the new exporting classes from config modules does this even have to be done in a release?

FYI: This will not necessarily be in 2.4.2, but should be done in 2.4 branch. We can do a new release for WL..

Revised: this is a high priority for 2.4.2 we will delay 2.4.2 if necessary to get this in.
Also the minimum requirements for this is to have sessions/roots work. Anything else is a nice to have which we can do in Ortega

Added support for WL 9.2 to the 2.4 branch for 2.4.3.  Also, merged to trunk.  Tim and I ran into an issue that actually existed in WL 8 but didn't cause any tests to fail but now does in WL 9.  To fix, we changed the Session in SessionRequest from a ThreadLocal to a session attribute to carry that state through a forward between servlets.
