## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I can't think of any situation where caching cookies is a good idea. Cookies are usually personalized to the requester, and contain things like a unique user id.

In my current project, the PageCachingFilter's persistence of cookies lead to an interesting case where one user would get another users' data. I assume more implementers of this filter will run into this problem.

Can you change PageCachingFilter to not include cookies in its cache?

I think my uses of this have never set cookies so I have not seen the issue. But I think you are right. Will change this and see if anyone screams. We can always make it configurable if they do.

In trunk and will be in ehcache-web-1.6.beta.

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
