## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently the "bind" attribute of the "server" element in the the tc-config.xml file binds the ip/port which the Terracotta Server listens for traffic on, and simultaneously defines the ip/port as the port for server-to-server communications to sync state (aka Network Passive).

It would be great to allow a separate ip/port to be defined for server-to-sever communications, such that there is extra (dedicated) bandwidth for the syncing of state. The clustered servers' secondary NIC can be on a separate switch or when there's just two, connected with a cross cable.
