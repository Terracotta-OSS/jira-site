## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Chris says that the code that maps ObjectStreamClass descriptors to integers has the same problem we had in the toolkit. Namely that instances of java.lang.Class for the primitive types (eg. Integer.TYPE, short.class, etc) fail to deserialize. 

The fix for the toolkit was to pre-seed the serializer for the primitive types (including Void!)
