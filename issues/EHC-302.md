## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, DiskStoreConfiguration automatically replaces user.home, user.dir, and java.io.tmpdir system properties.

Liferay uses Ehcache, and we usually run multiple Liferay's in a hosted environment which requires a separate dir. We don't want to have multiple users though, and at Liferay, we have a property called resource.repositories.root

We currently hard code that additional property, but would prefer a way to configure which properties will be read at runtime so we don't have to make a custom mod.

See http://support.liferay.com/browse/LEP-5166
