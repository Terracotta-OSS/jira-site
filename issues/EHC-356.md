Hi

I have applied the patch and created a bootstrap test.

Async bootstrap works fine, but not sync bootstrap. Can you please take a look at it. The code is in trunk.
You need to change the sampleCacheSync configuration as follows:

<bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.jgroups.JGroupsBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory"
                                   properties="bootstrapAsynchronously=false,
                                               maximumChunkSizeBytes=5000000"/>

I am not really familiar enough with the code to easily figure it out.
