## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Examples for maven plugin (like one in tc-maven-plugin\examples\tc-maven-plugin-sample) are using the following configuration in tc-config.xml

  <clients>
    <logs>target/terracotta/%(tc.nodeName)</logs>

Then name of tc.nodeName system property is set automatically by Maven plugin or can be specified using:

  <configuration>
    <processes>
      <process nodeName="master" ...

However projects generated with Maven archetypes don't use such convention and puts logs to the user.home dir:

  pojo archetype:
----
  <clients>
    <logs>%(user.home)/terracotta/client-logs/org.foo.fff.fff/%D</logs>
----

  webapp archetype:
----
  <servers>
    <server name="localhost" host="localhost">
       ....
      <data>%(user.home)/terracotta/data</data>
      <logs>%(user.home)/terracotta/logs</logs>
    </server>
    ...
  </servers>
  <clients>
    <logs>%(user.home)/terracotta/%(tc.nodeName)</logs>
  </clients>

Then new CVT stuff is using its own defaults for the data directories, and by default creates bunch of folders like statistics\* in the current dir. More over, CVT is using its own system property to specify node name (tc.node-name vs. tc.nodeName). 

Here is the error message printed on console then CVT detects folder conflict:

[INFO] [dso start] 2008-03-25 19:07:51,031 ERROR -
[INFO] [dso start] \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
[INFO] [dso start] The statistics store couldn't be opened at
[INFO] [dso start] 'C:\dev\terr\20spring\statistics'.
[INFO] [dso start] The CVT gathering system will not be active for this node.
[INFO] [dso start]
[INFO] [dso start] A common reason for this is that you're launching several Terracotta L1
[INFO] [dso start] clients on the same machine. The default directory for the statistics store
[INFO] [dso start] uses the IP address of the machine that it runs on as the identifier.
[INFO] [dso start] When several clients are being executed on the same machine, a typical solution
[INFO] [dso start] to properly separate these directories is by using a JVM property at startup
[INFO] [dso start] that is unique for each client.
[INFO] [dso start]
[INFO] [dso start] For example:
[INFO] [dso start]   dso-java.sh -Dtc.node-name=node1 your.main.Class
[INFO] [dso start]
[INFO] [dso start] You can then adapt the tc-config.xml file so that this JVM property is picked
[INFO] [dso start] up when the statistics directory is configured by using %(tc.node-name) in the
[INFO] [dso start] statistics path.

It would be really nice to have standard conventions for those folders and system properties that would be used by default and consistent across all components/projects. 

I'd suggest to use "terracotta" dir from the project folder and have corresponding subfolders in it. For example, something like this:

terracotta/
  server-data/
  server-logs/
  server-statistics/
  node1-logs/
  node1-statistics/
  node2-logs/
  node2-statistics/

Imho, unless there's a general mechanism provided through Terracotta
to uniquely and repeatedly identify individual nodes at startup, this
can't really be solved. Adding the property by default to
tc-config.xml when it is only resolved when Maven is used feels a bit
hackish to me. Btw, the reason why I chose tc.node-name as the
property name is because we use tc.install-root in the server. So to
me it looked consistent.
