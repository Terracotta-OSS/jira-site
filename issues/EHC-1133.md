## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I believe that most if not all combinations of count based and byte based sizing across tiers are illegal.  These should be rejected during configuratrion parsing/validation but many are not.  These configurations can then behave in weird ways at runtime since they are not very well handled when the configuration is converted in to an extant cache.

In the particular case that I was drawn to a combination of count based disk sizing and byte based heap sizing causes the heap tier to end up with no capacity constraint at all.  We should consider doing a full sweep of all possible combinations of capacity constraints and validate the behavior of each one.
