## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently the code validating the configuration is scattered a little bit all over the code base (mainly in init() methods of instances).
Including sometimes making decisions about overriding certain defaults because of other settings and the like...
I'd like to see a more unified way of validating configurations so that once validated (and consolidated), one can just read of the config object how the cache should be or is currently configured... EHC-650 & EHC-687 are both hints to this, but I would guess they are others.
