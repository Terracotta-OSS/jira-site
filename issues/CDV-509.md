## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Steve H wanted me to add this, so go to him for details. 

I hacked together some code to keep statistics about the dso lock acquires that our clustered ehcache module does. When i told steve about it, he said there should be an API for doing that. I don't have much a clear idea what the form of that API is, so talk to Steve. The stuff I hacked together may or not ever get checked in, it just exists to debug a customer problem at the moment -- not even sure it will be useful in that context
