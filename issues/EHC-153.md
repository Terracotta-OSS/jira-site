## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The ehcache website (http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/) has link to the JavaDoc in the "Documentation" section of its menu.

The link points to the following address:
http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/apidocs/index.html

The address is wrong. A browser displays a blank page if I go there, as if zero-length response is received.

The JavaDocs are actually located at the following address:
http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/javadoc/

(As is mentioned in overview-summary.html of the JavaDocs bundled with ehcache 1.2.4)

--
Note: If you try to access any random non-existent page on the site, you get an error-404 page by sourceforge, but this address returns response code 200 with zero-length content.

Best regards,

New site generated and uploaded with references to apidocs changed to javadoc. The link you reported and about 8 others are now fixed.
