## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Normally, Eclipse plugin marks all instrumented classes with a red checkmark.  However, If I use the tim-annotations module (http://forge.terracotta.org/releases/projects/tim-annotations/) to mark a class for Terracotta instrumentation, the red checkmark does not appear.

I would be nice for the Eclipse plugin to incorporate Terracotta Integration Module in determined whether or not the checkmark appears.   Thanks.

Problem also affects the @DMI + @AutolockXYZ annotations from tim-annotations

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.1-nightly, as of 20081030-161010 (Revision 10718 by cruise@su10mo5 from 2.7), if annotations @nstrumentedClass it is marked as instrumented class, the red check mark is appeared as expected.

Steps:
1. Install the eclipse plugin 2.7.1-nightly, Revision 10718
2. Download tim-annotations module from forge
 svn checkout   http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/forge/projects/tim-annotations/tags/release-1.2.0   tim-annotations-1.2.0
3. Import tim-annotations project into the eclipse
4. Add the Terracotta nature
5. Select the @InstrumentedClass (under InstrumentedClass.java) and right click (Terracotta| Type InstrumentedClass| Insrumented) to mark as Instrumented class

Actual: red check mark is appeared next to @InstrumentedClass and  InstrumentedClass.java (which is expected)
In the tc-config.xml, added as 
<include>
          <class-expression>org.terracotta.modules.annotations.InstrumentedClass+</class-expression>
 </include>

6. Select the @DMI (under DMI.java) and right click (Terracotta| Type DMI| Insrumented) to mark as Instrumented class

Actual: red check mark is appeared next to @DMI and  DMI.java (which is expected)
In the tc-config.xml, added as 
<include>
          <class-expression>org.terracotta.modules.annotations.DMI+</class-expression>
 </include>

<include>
          <class-expression>org.terracotta.modules.annotations.DMI+</class-expression>
        </include>
