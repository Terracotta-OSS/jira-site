I have fixed this (it was a coding error during the store rewrite).  It still needs test coverage - I'll attempt to devise a test-case that reproduces this reasonably quickly.

Fix is in for Esperance/Taraval. Hopefully tests will be too:)

Doesn't look like the test coverage is coming. This is already released.
