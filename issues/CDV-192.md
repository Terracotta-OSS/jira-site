## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

the boot jar validate feature should terminate the process if it finds an issue - currently it seems that it lets the process continue.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Test what happens on WL and Tomcat. As long as it doesn't do anything bad this is ok for now.  And has reasonable error messaging.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The bootjar validation happens early, before the main method has be entered, so the normal uncaught-exception handling isn't in place.
Changed the DSO startup code to exit if an error occurs.
