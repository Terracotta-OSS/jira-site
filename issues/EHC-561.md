## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From stack trace, saw a thread like this that is assumed to be an executor related thread in Ehcache:

"pool-1-thread-1" prio=6 tid=0x04454400 nid=0x1230 waiting on
condition [0x04e7f000]
 java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (parking)
	at sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)
	- parking to wait for  <0x0bc9bf88> (a java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject)
	at java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:158)
	at java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.await(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1925)
	at java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue.take(LinkedBlockingQueue.java:358)
	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getTask(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:947)
	at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:907)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)

Executors seem to be created in two places in Ehcache core:
- Cache has an executorService field that is initialized in getExecutorService()
- MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatReceiver has a processingThreadPool initialized in init()

Should use a thread factory for these to get the threads named better.
