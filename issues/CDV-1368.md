## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Right now exceptions and other stuff that happens in the console just basically gets dumped to stdout.  I'm not aware of docs on how to split that off to a file instead but I would love to have that.  Often I'm not watching or even able to watch stdout/stderr of the console so I miss anything that might get spit out there.

Might want to try things like System.setErr()/setOut(). That way things can redirected instead of doing it in the shell above. 

We don't have a log file yet for the admin console, but we could put the output in a tab in the console maybe

I'm sure I personally could make this happen, but this is really a request for a user-visible feature.
