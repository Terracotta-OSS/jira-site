<div markdown="1" class="description">

Before I run tc:clean:

logs-192.168.110.103	src			tc-config.xml
pom.xml			target			terracotta


After:

tmac:sample-annotations tgautier$ ls

pom.xml			target			terracotta

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Plugin version 1.0.5 is indeed not cleaning up logs and data dirs.
Plugin version 1.0.6-SNAPSHOT in 2.5 branch currently isn't working because of some tc dependencies not available in tc maven repo, so I can't verify it.

However I haven't been able to reproduce this with 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT plugin, so it seem like issue been already fixed in trunk.

I also noticed that tc:clean wasn't cleaning the stats dirs from CVT, so I've added those to cleanup and committed fix to the trunk.

Please note that if logs dirs are declared like <logs>terracotta/%(tc.nodeName)-logs</logs>, tc:clean won't delete terracotta dir, but it will wipe out all \*-logs dirs that match nodes configured in <processes> element of tc plugin.

Should be fixed in trunk (1.1.0-SNAPSHOT version). Please reopen if you still have same issue.
