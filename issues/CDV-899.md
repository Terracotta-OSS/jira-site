## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I see this behavior happening in both 2.6.2 and 2.7.0-stable1-ish.  Gary K confirmed on 2.6.2. 

I'm running a tc app that does locking continuously.  If I turn the Lock Profiler in the admin console on and set trace depth to 0 and Refresh I see lock instances but all stats are set to 0, which I find surprising.  I expect to see stats but no stack traces for instances of the lock.

It appears Antonio was using a traceDepth == 0 as an indication that profiling was disabled.

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.2-nightly, as of 20081130-161118 (Revision 10921 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), it is working as expected. Tested with sharededitor sample, the stats values are displayed when trace depth is set to 0.
