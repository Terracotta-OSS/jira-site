## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a passive terracotta attempts to start against a "dirty" object database it can optionally move aside these files and start with an empty database. The data is moved aside instead of simply deleted in case it might be needed later. This function however does not apply to the ehcache search index files which will be indiscriminately deleted when a passive server initializes

Don't think I can commit to this by TP2/Vicente code freeze.

Added (disabled) IndexRolloverTest that sort of reproduces the issue. Specifically it captures a case where the object db gets rolled over (or deleted), but the index db just stays in place. This leads to a server with an empty object db but non-empty index db.
