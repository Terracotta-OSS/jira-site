## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I've seen a number of people end up locking \*tons\* of code because of the chain of UnlockedSharedExceptions they get. We should provide messaging when UnlockedSharedException happens about how they probably don't want to blindly lock where we tell them they need locking in the error.

Once place we can point them to is the new Lock Primer in the Concept and Architeture Guide:

http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Concept+and+Architecture+Guide#ConceptandArchitectureGuide-Locks
(obviously don't link directly to this URL-- use the reflector)

We might consider augmenting this even more to highlight this issue and suggest ways around it.
