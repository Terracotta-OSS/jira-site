## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

the stats are a big feature.  

I am thinking it should be co-located with the lock stats as a high level entry on the left list of nodes, in between garbage collection and lock stats

I think the thread dumps and runtime stats should be on the left too.

actually I think thread dumps are in the same category - I think they should be in the left tree.

this could also give us the option to make the runtime stats label red, to indicate they are running.

Tested with Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev7833, as of 20080331-190316 (Revision 7833 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.6), it is working as expected.

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample application launcher
3. Launch the sharededitor demo
4. Launch the admin console
5. In the admin console, expand the Terracotta cluster tree

Expected: Roots, Classes, Lock profiler, Garbage collection, Thread dumps, Cluster statistics recorder to be listed as high level entry on the left pane
Actual: Roots, Classes, Lock profiler, Garbage collection, Thread dumps, Cluster statistics recorder are listed as expected.

6. expand the Servers | ipaddress:port

Expected: Runtime statistics and Thread dumps to be listed on the left pane
Actual:  Runtime statistics and Thread dumps are listed as expected.

7. expand the Clients | ip address:port
Expected: Runtime statistics and Thread dumps to be listed on the left pane
Actual:  Runtime statistics and Thread dumps are listed as expected.

8. Verify the label of the Runtime stats for Servers and Clients

Expected: Runtime stats label to be red to indicate they are running
Actual: label red is not displayed.

Step 8 feature is not working as expected, please refer to DEV-1437
