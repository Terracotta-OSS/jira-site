## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

the statistics don't auto-start as they did in previous consoles.  It's a bit difficult to find the "play" button, I think they should auto-start when the ui is presented.  If the user presses "pause" then navigates away and to the screen, they should not auto-start (in other words, auto-start once and only once)

</div>

Tested with Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev7861, as of 20080401-190405 (Revision 7861 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.6), it is working as expected i.e., all runtime statistics for servers and clients are auto-started once. 

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample application launcher
3. Launch the sharededitor demo
4. Launch the admin console
5. In the admin console, expand the Terracotta cluster tree | Servers | ipaddress:port and select the Runtime statistics
6. In the admin console, expand the Terracotta cluster tree | Clients | ipaddress:port and select the Runtime statistics

Expected: All statistics should auto-start
Actual: All runtime statistics are auto-started as expected

6. click the "pause" button on the right pane and verify that all the statistics are stopped
7. click the "play" button to restart the statistics

Actual: All runtime statistics are restarted again

</div>
