## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Would be awesome to see a lock hop SRA.  It should count the # of lock hops since the last collection, so it would be a count during the period of stat collection.

For example:

period 0: 20
period 1: 0
period 2: 2
period 3: 25

The total lock hops during this session is 47.
