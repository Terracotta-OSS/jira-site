## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From looking at some customer logs on the forum (http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/910.page), there are some warnings like this:
tc\_client\_01.log:2008-04-13 16:55:04,251 [CacheInvalidator -  
org.hibernate.cache.UpdateTimestampsCache invalidation thread0] WARN  
com.tc.object.logging.RuntimeLoggerImpl - could not find proper stack  
frame:  
<<com.tc.object.logging.RuntimeLoggerImpl.getTrimmedStack(RuntimeLoggerImpl.java:215)>>, 
<<com.tc.object.logging.RuntimeLoggerImpl.appendCall(RuntimeLoggerImpl.java:113)>>,  
<<com.tc.object.logging.RuntimeLoggerImpl.namedLockAcquired(RuntimeLoggerImpl.java:93)>>,  
<<com.tc.object.logging.RuntimeLoggerImpl.lockAcquired(RuntimeLoggerImpl.java:86)>>, 
<<com.tc.object.bytecode.ManagerImpl.begin(ManagerImpl.java:323)>>,  
<<com.tc.object.bytecode.ManagerImpl.beginLock(ManagerImpl.java:298)>>, 
<<com.tcclient.cache.Lock.writeLock(Lock.java:53)>>,  
<<com.tcclient.cache.CacheEntryInvalidator.run(CacheEntryInvalidator.java:87)>>, 
<<com.tcclient.cache.CacheInvalidationTimer$EvictionRunner.run(CacheInvalidationTimer.java:53)>>,  
<<java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)>>

The code in RuntimeLoggerImpl.getTrimmedStack() is attempting to prune  
all of the stack below the call from  
"com.tc.object.bytecode.ManagerUtil".  In the stack above  
com.tcclient.cache.Lock.writeLock() is calling ManagerImpl directly instead of  
going through ManagerUtil.  I suspect that's due to some refactoring I  
did to make this more testable a while back (switching the call to the  
static method in ManagerUtil to a call to an injected Manager instance).

We need to either stop trimming the stack at all, or be more flexible with when we filter, or change the ehcache code back to go through ManagerUtil.

Should be more flexible with what we filter here.

I'd actually vote for removing the "trimmed" stack thing completely. Makes this easy to solve :-)

Need to deprecate use of <caller> in <runtime-output-options>
