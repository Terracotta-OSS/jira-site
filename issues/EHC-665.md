Made constructor public. It was package local.

Before there were no constructors, so there was an implicit empty constructor.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The reason why this was made package private is to ensure that the mandatory config parameters cacheName and maxElementsInMemory are always provided. Without this, people can forget to add them and create an invalid cache. I opted to mandate this simply through API instead of runtime checks.
