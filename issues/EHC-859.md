## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi,

the current ehcache.xsd schema available at http://ehcache.org/ehcache.xsd is not a valid schema.

at line 122, the definition 
```<xs:element name="cache1" ref="jsr107:cache" />```
 is not correct as attribute ref is forbidden in a top element

Detailed message :
{{s4s-att-not-allowed: Attribute 'ref' cannot appear in element 'element'.}}

In the http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd file, annotation for element definition is:
{quote}
The element element can be used either
   at the top level to define an element-type binding globally,
   or within a content model to either reference a globally-defined
   element or type or declare an element-type binding locally.
   The ref form is not allowed at the top level.
{quote}

Regards
