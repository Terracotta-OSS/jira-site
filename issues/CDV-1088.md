## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Requesting support for an Eclipselink Terricotta coordinated cache 
implementation.  

There are several advantages over a Hibernate cache integration.

- Hibernate only caches serialized objects (not heap objects).
- Hibernate detached objects only address simple local workflow scenarios.
- Detached objects do not support lazy loading, further limiting their 
usefulness.  Merging is slow since the whole detached graph is queried 
from the database.
- Hibernate does not enforce unique object identity.

Eclipselink on the other hand, has a real heap object cache, that enforces 
object identity across a distributed coordinated cache.  Detaching is 
implicit, and there really is no need to cache outside the Eclipselink 
cache (detach), since the Eclipselink cache contains heap objects.  Lazy 
loading exceptions you can get with Hibernate (when navigating detached 
object graphs) is not an issue with Eclipselink.  So you never have the 
cost of Merging a detached object graph to navigate deeper into the graph.

Eclipselink also has a UnitOfWork session concept for updates that 
generates a local copy of the cached graph.  Only if the copy avoids an 
optimistic lock exception, and the db transaction is successful, does the 
cache get updated with (only) the incremental changes from the copy.  In 
the case of a failed transaction, rollback avoids any change to the 
pre-transaction state in the cache.

Transaction UnitOfWork support may also make possible a generalized 
mechanism to support transaction rollback of all transaction objects 
(in-memory pojos as well as persistent orm objects), as well as automatically 
maintaining cache coherence for committed and rollbacked transactions.  

Eclipselink could make it possible to cache any portion of a domain model db 
(even fully cache it), \*and\* keep the cached domain transactionally 
synchronized with a db.  
Ideally the later would not be necessary, so that the Terracotta db 
would be the system of record.  But practically speaking relational 
persistence is also necessary in many cases, particularly for transactional 
records (orders, accounts, etc...), reporting, and querying.

With Eclipselink you could potentially have the entire db cached 
by Terracotta, yet transparently maintain synchronization with the db 
system of record.  If there is any doubt that the two are not in synch, 
you could just drop the Terracotta cache and allow it to naturally get 
rebuilt.

And besides just the cache, in my opinion Eclipselink has a superior 
architecture overall and amazing feature set.  

As well it is the JPA reference implementation, and combined 
with Eclipse community support i believe it will gain serious adoption 
over time.

Also very nice would be integration of the Eclipselink cache into your 
monitoring/profiling tools.

Here are some related links.  In particular, the dzone link gives a 
comment made by someone that maybe able to help with such an effort.  If i 
can find the time i would also love to help.

Very interesting. The most important things for getting something like this started are:
1) Community involvement. i.e. someone from eclipselink doing dev on it
2) A specific user/usecase
