## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi all !

I just found this greate product and wanna congradulate
you for your hard work.

As NHibernate is a .net port from java Hibernate, do
you have plans to port also ehcache to a "N"ehcache ???

This would be wonderfull for us, .net - nhibernate
users - have features ehcache has...

Please, think about it !
