## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hello ;-)

I've had a closer look into the bug I reported
(#1424503) and saw that the ObjectInputStream in the
DiskStore was not closed.

If it's closed, the Bug is fixed ;-)

So I submit a tiny patch for this (including a
StackTrace output for log.error()).

cu,
Sebastian
