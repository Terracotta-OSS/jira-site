## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'll add a testRehash() method to ConcurrentHashMapTestApp momentarily to demonstrates the issue. 

So if you have an unshared map with a bunch of keys that don't override hashCode(), then share it, and then try to do get() you might get back null.  I think this should only happen in node that first shares the map

This doesn't seem to be a new problem. It's broken in 2.6 at least. I don't think it is super likely that someone will it (most people don't use identity based keys in CHM, and most CHM are probably shared before any thing is added to them -- both of which workaround this problem).
