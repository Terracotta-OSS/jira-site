## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

What if the admin console had the eclipse wizard built in. 

It should start with loading a config file.  Then the server and clients are all configured to load it from http from the admin console - the admin console has to make it available over http.

Then for every iteration, the admin console figures out what is wrong, suggests it, and updates the file appropriately.  At the end of the cycle you can "file | save" the file back to where it was loaded (or file | save as).

</div>
