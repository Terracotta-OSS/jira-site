## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In at least the open-bsd port of OpenJDK (and possibly other OpenJDK versions) the platform identifier strings are not the same per platform as they are in Hotspot.  This means the express client code fails to identify the correct native Sigar lib to load.  This wouldn't be a huge issue, except that on failure to identify the platform an NPE is triggered currently.  We should at least fail gracefully here, and maybe consider adding some more recognized platforms.

As an example:

Hotspot:
os.name : Mac OS X
os.arch : x86\164
os.version : 10.5.8

OpenJDK:
os.name : Darwin
os.arch : amd64
os.version : 9.8.0

Is this relatively easy to do?

I have fixed this for trunk of toolkit, I assume that I should merge it to the tc-3.5.0 branch once the Fremantle RC is cut.
