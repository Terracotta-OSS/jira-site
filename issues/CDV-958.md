## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Dont understand why system properties needs to be recorded in stats recorder at certain frequency.  Most of the time it gets recorded anyways since ppl dont uncheck it making the stats file larger than it needed to be. We could probably remove it or leave it unchecked by default and I doubt if anyone will miss it.

Same goes to thread dump. There are other ways of doing thread dump and it is a costly operation too if we are taking cluster wide thread dumps. Doesnt seem like a good candidate for capturing it periodically. (at least indefinitely)

I think the description commentary is in err.  Those stats aren't polled for.
