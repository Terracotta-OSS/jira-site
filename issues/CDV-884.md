## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">


Currently we can specify locks in our config via expressions.
But this configuration specifies only what can be included - so if a user uses an expression like:

  \* com.example..set\*(..) 

It will configure locking for methods beginning with set\* under the com.example.. package.
But what if there are 3 methods, eg: setFoo(..), setBar(..), setZoo(..) - and the user wants a lock on everything but setZoo(...) - ? There is no way for them to exclude setZoo(..)
