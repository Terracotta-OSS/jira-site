## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the Declarative Configuration section of the online Cache Loader documentation (http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/cache\_loaders.html) the example is for a classLoaderFactory as it should be.  However, text above the example talks about Event Listeners and Exception Handlers.
