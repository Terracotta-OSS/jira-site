## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is the error I got running with TC Maven plugin:

[INFO] [bootjar] 2007-09-29 11:45:19,207 ERROR - com.tc.bundles.Resolver$Message@165c7f6

I think this is heavily related to CDV-435 or even duplicating it. The problem is that tcbuild deploys module jars as \1-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar so there is no \1-1.0.0.jar to resolve, even so tc.properties refers to \1-1.0.0.jar.

My current workaround is to rename all module jars in local Maven repository to \1-1.0.0.jar

The work done on the Resolver, solved half of this issue.
I've updated the plugin to take those changes into account.
