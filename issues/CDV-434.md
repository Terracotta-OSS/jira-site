## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

 Currently we dont differentiate a lookup from the client or a server in the ObjectManager. When we receive a lookup for a non-existent object in the server, we consider it as a bug in the system (which it is) and throw an AssertionError which inturn crashes the server. 

Instead we should propagate that error to the client that requested it. That way only the misbehaving client will crash and the assertion will be closer to the problem.
