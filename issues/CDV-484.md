## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/579.page

If you don't have svn in your path (or svn info fails for whatever reason), tcbuild gives a rather uninformative error message:

 buildscripts/build-tc.rb:[28,30]:[841,887]: BUILD FAILED (RuntimeError)
org.leafcutter.core.TaskRunnerException: Encountered before (: exec executable=svn errorproperty=executer\1er

ta-2.4.5-src\code\base(arg line="-version") 

Maybe the error message should be a little more obvious about what is wrong. 

In one example,. someone had deleted all of the ".svn" directories which was making "svn info" fail. The error message was similar

Fixed.

svn is used only for retrieving metadata for automated builds.  As such, I've fixed the code to not crash if svn is not in path.
