## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently the Fast Restart Store recovery code completely fails the recovery leaving the data files unmodified if there are errors during the recovery of any of the cache entries. This is a "maximally safe" approach designed to prevent the accidental destruction of an entire log if the recovering environment is accidentally misconfigured. This could happen for example if the environment was missing some or all of the domain classes due to an error when configuring the classpath.

This feature would add the ability for users to choose to drop any entries that cannot be correctly recovered.

</div>
