<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The Spring demos in trunk (for TC 2.7) now use Spring 2.5.4 libraries (DEV-1678).  I tried updating the Spring webflow demo to use webflow 2.0.2, but the webflow API has changed significantly and so we can't make the switch w/o doing some work on that demo.  In the meantime, the existing demo still seems to work with Spring 2.5.4 and webflow 1.0.

There is a webflow migration guide here: http://static.springframework.org/spring-webflow/docs/2.0.x/reference/html/ch14.html
