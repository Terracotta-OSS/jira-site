## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When sharing .project with Terracotta Nature other users need to remove TC Nature and add it back to work. If a user tries to launch the project's DSO server it will compain that it couldn't succesfully launch, until the user removes the TC nature and adds it back again.

When importing a Terracotta-enabled project, don't remove the TerracottaNature just because the config file isn't specified.  Instead, popup the project preferences to allow the user to set.

Import -> Maven Project  (works fine)
Import -> Existing Project (can't navigate to existing tc-config.xml, gets stuck)
