## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hello,

The problem is that I cannot create my caches from a 
class that is also a CacheManagerEventListener because 
the CacheManager.init method is called in the 
CacheManager contructor.

Ex. :

cacheManager = CacheManager.create(configFileName);
// Too late to register for events, they were already 
sent!
cacheManager.setCacheManagerEventListener(this);

Solution:

a) Have 4 public static create methods to create the 
CacheManager singleton instance:

private void create(Configuration configuration)
private void create(String configurationFileName)
private void create(URL configurationURL)
private void create(InputStream 
configurationInputStream)

b) Make the init method public.

c) Let the user call the init method after setting the 
CacheManagerEventListener.

New code becomes :

cacheManager = CacheManager.create(configFileName);
cacheManager.setCacheManagerEventListener(this);
cacheManager.init();

d) You should follow the standard way of adding and 
removing listeners (and allow multiple instances) :

addCacheManagerEventListener(...)
removeCacheManagerEventListener(...)

Thanks.

Hi

a) is already how it works.

b) and c) This change would break all current uses of ehcache.

d) I am only supporting one CacheManagerEventListener, thus the set rather 
than add. There can however be multiple CacheEventListeners. 

To do what you want to do, you can use a CacheManagerEventListener such 
as CountingCacheEventListener created with a factory like 
TestCacheManagerEventListenerFactory. You can find both of these in the test 
sources. You configure it in ehcache.xml as follows: 

<cacheManagerEventListenerFactory 
class="net.sf.ehcache.event.TestCacheManagerEventListenerFactory"
            properties="type=counting"/>

Then your this class can access the listener and process the events.

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
