## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The setup: Running two WebSphere 8.0.4 in cluster and accesing them through IHS server, loadbalancer set to roundrobin and sticky sessions.

One node of Terracotta running on a separate machine. All RHEL 6.2 servers. 

Wicket 6 application uses Terracotta filter in web.xml, where WebSphere 7 filter is used (no version 8 is available AFAIK). 

The problem: Session ID is corrupt and does not allow affinity, because the part with server ID is always -1. After looking at WebsphereIdGenerator it seems the problem is in getCloneId method, which does not recognize WebSphere version 8.

One possible workaround would be to "fake" WebSphere version to 7, but I don't know how :(

Hallo Tim, 
i've just read the issue https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/CDV-258, and it seems that "websphere AS support removed from 2.7 and future releases". Is that really it? If yes, then there might be the problem with cloneId on WebSphere 8, resp. IHS webserver. Without generating proper cloneId the whole IBM thing won't work...

My cluster is still ready, can you point me to a place in code where to try to fix it?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

that comment back on CDV-258 I think applies to when we stopped supporting the IBM JDK in general for DSO usage. That was a long time ago though, before we created our so called "express" version of the terracotta product which I think started with terracotta 3.3.x

We haven't supported websphere 8 (and 8.5 for that matter) until our very soon to be released 4.0.1 version. 

From what I remember I don't think we actually needed to tweak anything for differences between websphere 7 and 8, but I could believe the code in 3.7.x doesn't account for version 8 as you describe. 

Backfilling support for new websphere version back into something like 3.7.x is probably only something that could be initiated from a paid support contract. If that isn't an option here I think trying out the 4.0.1 version would be your best bet.
