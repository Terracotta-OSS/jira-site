## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a somewhat strange setup with a home grown class
loader, which in some circumstances may access a Cache
instance. This class loader is set as the context class
loader on multiple threads.

Consider this situation: T1 loads a class C1 and waits
to access the cache. T1 has a lock on the class loader
due to going through the synchronized
ClassLoader.loadClass() method. T2 accesses the cache -
hence locks the cache instance as get() is synchronized
- and needs to load the requested entry from disk.
During deserialization the
DiskStore.loadElementFromDiskElement() method tries
to deserialize the entry and uses the thread context
class loader to load the class.

Result:
  T1 waits for T2's lock on the cache object
  T2 waits for T1's lock on the class loader

If I replace the call

   classLoader.loadClass(clazz.getName());

with

   Class.forName(clazz.getName(), false, classLoader);

I do not get the deadlock, provided the entry's class
has already been loaded.

I attach a patch for this small change.
