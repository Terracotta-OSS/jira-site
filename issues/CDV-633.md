## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Refer to forum thread

This guys is touching many distributed locks in his JVM. When LockGC run, it locks ClientLockManagerImpl, which prevent grant/release of the lock until LockGC completes. I his case LockGc takes 5 seconds to execute (see the attached thread dump in the posts) and lock activities are halted during that time, resulting into the transaction rate drop to zero during LockGC.
