Are you trying to import a "Cluster" thread dump into one of these tools?  Those are a collection of thread dumps and that would be the problem.  What we need is the ability to export a cluster thread dump as a ZIP file.

Not about the exporting option. I copied the individual thread dumps into a file and trying to analyze that thread dump with these tools. Java version 1.5.0\113.

Make sure that single thread dump can be analyzed

This won't be possible since the thread dumps we generate are not the same format as those generated by the JVM.  For instance, we don't have access to the thread attributes tid and nid, which are the addresses of native artifacts.
