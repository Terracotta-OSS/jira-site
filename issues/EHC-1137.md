## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Logging code in \{\{net.sf.ehcache.pool.impl.DefaultSizeOfEngine#sizeOf\}\} will always perform \{\{String\}\} concatenation when a \{\{MaxDepthExceededException\}\} is thrown.

This should be changed to leverage slf4j and not have the concatenation if logging is suppressed.

This was raised in https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-11097
