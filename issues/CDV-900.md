## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The admin console completely hangs if you try to incorrectly connect to TC server via the DSO port (9510) rather than the correct JMX port (9520).  The UI becomes completely unresponsive, doesn't even respond to apple-Q on a Mac.  I spent way too much time trying to figure this out before I realized my mistake - seems like we could make this fail faster.  The console immediately fails intuitively if a nonexistant server or port is entered.

Gary has a fix for this, 2.7. It's a very annoying usability issue

Now explicitly check if we can connect to the proposed JMX port via HTTP and fail if successful.
