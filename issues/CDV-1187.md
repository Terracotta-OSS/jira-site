## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is a placeholder item for issues I've found in the session invalidation code in jetty 6.1.15. I'll attach links to the bugs in the jetty JIRA once I create them

We should not release trunk of tim-jetty until a updated version of jetty is released I believe. 

http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-947
http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-948

MultiNodeInvaldatorTest should be re-enabled when the issues are sorted out

We can still use 6.1.15 in the kit I think. If I roll back the new jetty integration stuff for trunk of tim-jetty then the new'broken jetty code won't be running

I don't think this item has any ties to Rivera. It is really only relevant to the uncompleted and not-live jetty integration
