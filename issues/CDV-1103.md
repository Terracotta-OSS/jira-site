## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I've shared a Terraccotta project by Eclipse -> Team -> Shara project (using SVN).
The project was originally created like Java Project and then naturalized as Terracotta.
The project has the tc-config.xml placed in src folder and project -> properties -> terracotta -> 'terracotta configuration' is equals to 'src\tc-config.xml'
The local project works fine: server and client application see the src/tc-config.xml.
When another person import the project by SVN -> checkout project by SVN have to reconfigure manually the location of tc-configuration.xml file.
