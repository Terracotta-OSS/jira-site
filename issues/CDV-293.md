## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This problem is reported by http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/280.page

BUG DETAILS:
App Code:
session.invalidate();
request.getSession(true).getAttribute("...");

Container Behavior:
Tomcat will create a new session as long as response has not been commited.

TC Session Behavior:
TCS throws IllegalStateException exception on all session-related operation after session.invalidate() has been called.


FIX DETAILS:
We will have to do the following:
- if response has been committed throw IllegalStateException
- else, correctly release the lock on the old session id
- generate a new session id and acquire a lock on it
- write new session cookie (if request hopped a server this might create 2 session id cookies, so the old one should be removed)
- proceed with the request and unlock the new session id at the end
- if request is forwarded more complications arise
