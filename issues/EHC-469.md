## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need to make sure that long-running test of the monitor doesn't have memory leaks.  Should test probes coming and going, caches coming and going, query functionality (if possible), etc.

Test plan for ehcache-dx LRT:

1.	Start ehcache-dx server
2.	Start client with a dummy cacheManager registered to ehcache-dx server
3.	Add new cache managers to the clients. (There is no need to creating a new client to introduce new probes. Confirmed with Geert)
4.	Cache managers registered to ehcache-dx server should be random b/w 2-5
5.	Add cache to cache Manager. No. of caches should be random b/w 1-5
6.	Can add variety of replication modes. Non-replicated, Terracotta and RMI.
7.	Do some operations on the cache (gets, puts, etc) for a configurable duration.
8.	Get stats for the operations.
9.	Validate no. of cache managers/caches registered. Since gets and puts are occurring, validate the txn/sec doesn't go below 5.
10.	Remove cache after operations
11.	Shutdown cache manager
12.	The duration should also be random, as don't want all caches/cache manager registered/deregister at same time. (optional)
13.	LRT should repeat steps 3-12 after some interval.

Test properties

1.	Max cache managers
2.	Max caches to cache manager
3.	Duration of get-stats
4.	Test Interval

Added another mode too, which starts server few min later than clients. Thus, clients are blocked waiting for server to get up.
