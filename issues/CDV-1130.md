## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I added a new test method testEntrySetToArray3() to GenericMapTestApp in trunk. For ConcurrentHashMap, TreeMap and THashMap this test fails. 

This is a fairly esoteric means to mutate a map in my opinion, but it should work. Right now the mutation will be made locally but not propagated to the distributed state of the map
