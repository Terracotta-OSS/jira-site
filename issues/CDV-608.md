part of what needs to be decided here is what it means to cluster this type. A regular WeakHashMap is pretty clear, but how it behaves in the cluster isn't immediately obvious to me. The only thing I can think of is that mappings are removed iff the keys can be DGC'd. Also not sure if WHM's implementation of piggy-backing weak reference processing on application threads is appropriate for shared instances.

One final note is that WHM (at least it's impl) is very different in the azul VM as opposed to Suns
