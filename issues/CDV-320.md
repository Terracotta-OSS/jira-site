Available here:

Uses the new Maven stuff.

Also added mvn config modules for the dependencies here:

If this project is not going to be included as part of the kit, it cannot be in the labs.  It must be promoted to forge projects.  The same applies to the dependencies, they are generic dependencies, and thus must move to the top level forge projects.

The scope of this for Ortega (2.5) is to have it functional, and in the Forge (downloadable).  There is additional scope for this scheduled for Pacheco...
