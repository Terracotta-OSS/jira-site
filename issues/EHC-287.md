## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, you can not configure ehcache to not use a diskstore - even if you don't allow any cache to overflow, you still need to configure a (unique) diskstore.

How about making it optional, and throwing errors if you try to overflow to disk without one?

This is a good idea and well overdue. Sorry about the delay in implementing it.

I have implemented this in ehcache 1.5 which will be out in beta soon. The change is in trunk.

The documentation on how it works is as below (in APT format):

\1\1 <<<DiskStore>>>s are Optional

     The diskStore element in ehcache.xml is now optional (as of 1.5). If all caches use only <<<MemoryStore>>>s,
     then there is no need to configure a diskStore. This simplifies configuration, and uses less threads.
     It is also good where where multiple CacheManagers are being used, and multiple disk store paths
     would need to be configured.

     If one or more caches requires a DiskStore, and none is configured, java.io.tmpdir will be used and
     a warning message will be logged to encourage explicity configuration of the diskStore path.

\1\1\1 Turning off disk stores

    To turn off disk store path creation, comment out the diskStore element in ehcache.xml.

    The <<<ehcache-failsafe.xml>>> configuration uses a disk store. This will remain the case so as to not affect
    existing ehcache deployments. So, if you do not wish to use a disk store make
    sure you specify your own ehcache.xml and comment out the diskStore element.
