## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I needed to build a watcher to automatically detect if there's a split brain and health status of the cluster. However, the beans interface is in tc.jar file and I'd rather NOT depend on the whole jar. Should these beans interfaces moved to common-api jar instead?

I'm maybe go as far as saying the set of TC types involved in any "public" jmx beans should be in discreet jar (something like tc-jmx-api.jar)

We think this is already done in trunk.  Merging back to 2.6 when 2.6-stable1 is released.

There is now a terracotta-jmx-api jar but it doesn't include every single thing that you need to deal with a cluster via JMX.
