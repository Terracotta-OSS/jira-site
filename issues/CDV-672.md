## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

bootjar tool spits out a stacktrace when scan fails.

when the bootjar tool attempts to create a bootjar, it will first perform a scan if it needs to build the bootjar, it will also verify if the bootjar it built is valid. if it finds something wrong, it will abort, and spit out a message and the stacktrace.

it should not spit out a stacktrace, this makes it look like the bootjar tool error'd out, instead of the config (to build the bootjar) or that the scan detected an invalid bootjar... we should just print a message indicating what was/is wrong with the bootjar or config, but log the error message and stacktrace instead.
