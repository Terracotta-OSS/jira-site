## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hello,

EHCache does not yet run on Java versions older than 
1.4. Reason for this 
is that you use the new 1.4 Exception constructors in 
class "net.sf.ehcache.CacheException". 

You only need a small fix to get this working: instead of 
inheriting from 
java.lang.Exception, change the class to inherit from 
org.apache.commons.lang.exception.NestableException. 
Of course, this 
creates a dependency to commons-lang, but Hibernate 
itself is dependent on 
it too, so that shouldn't be a problem. 

I've attached a patch file.

Best regards,
Ville Peurala

I am now using only the old constructors. This is backwardly
compatible with earlier versions of Java.

It does not require commons-lang.
