## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Unix shell scripts that exec dso-env pass arguments, and that is only supported under bash. We want to support sh, as well, since on Solaris bash doesn't come pre-installed.

. dso-env -q  ==> set -- -q; . dso-env

This should be targeted for the 2.4.1 update.

Env: solaris (s10qa1 machine)
Tested with rev5072(2.4-nightly), it is not working as expected.

Steps: 
Start the demo server:
1. Navigate to /terracotta-2.4-nightly-rev5072/samples/
2. execute ./start-demo-server.sh
Run the jtable demo:
3. Navigate to /terracotta-2.4-nightly-rev5072/samples/pojo/jtable
4. execute ../../../bin/dso-java.sh -cp classes demo.jtable.Main

Actual: ../../../bin/dso-java.sh: test: unknown operator == is displayed

bash has come pre-installed on Solaris since Solaris 9 was released about 5 years ago.

So we should not see these bash script related problems on Solaris.  I wonder if the the users .profile has a different script default.

We use "sh" shell in our script. In Linux, "sh" = "bash"

In solaris that is not the case, "sh" is "sh", but it also has "bash"

That's why our scripts have to be supportive of both "sh"  and "bash". It would be easier if we just specify "bash" script explicitly in our scripts and forget about "sh"
