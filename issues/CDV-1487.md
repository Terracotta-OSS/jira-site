## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This problem is new starting with 3.2.2 (and the 3.2.1 patches that allowed jdk 6u18+). 

Anything that relies on class exporting (tim-ehcache in 3.2 does in particular) will fail to work. 

The reason is that the required instrumentation is not added resin's base DynamicClassLoader implementation. This does not occur since that class is loaded before the TC client is running (we hook the initialization of the system class loader to start the TC client). Since resin replaces the system class loader the type gets loaded early and is not instrumented.

Newer versions of tim-ehcache that rely on the terracotta toolkit no longer need class export to work, but there might be other class exports out there that will still be broken. 

This problem isn't necessarily specific to resin, rather any use case where the system class loader is replaced

This patch works although it needs some cleanup and has only had minimal testing

In particular the adapated class dumper will not dump these adapted class loader types which is a little annoyin

the fix for this introduces some gnarly deadlocks, changes are rollback so this is still open
