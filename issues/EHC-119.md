sending all the other files under the cache directory
of the context activating ehcache).

Hi

I do not really understand what this means " it not only
caches that contexts, but also other context". 

Because this report is anonymous, no email will be sent when I update this, 
so I will close it. There are a ton of people using this with tomcat, and tomcat 
is one of the two app servers used in the web tests that run every time I do a 
build, so someone else should report this if it is an issue.
