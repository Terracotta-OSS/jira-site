## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Should link this feature to the giant config re-write. 

We had a forum user try to add autolocks with no instrumentation configured - which didn't work since there was no instrumentation specified.  It seems non-intuitive that auto-locks can be configured and aren't tied to instrumentation, so we should resolve this.

Either fix the ability to divorce the configuration of one from another when in reality auto-locks have dependencies on correct instrumentation configuration, or make it so that an auto-lock spec ensures that an instrumentation spec is also added.

The forum post was here: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/551.page
