## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently according to the configuration file schema the "name" attribute of the <server> element is required, while the "host" attribute defaults to the value of the "name" attribute and is optional.  This is reversed, "host" should be required and the value of "name" (if not specified) should default to the "host" value.

Demo configuration files (as well as the schema and reference tc-config.xml file) should be updated to instead look like this:

....
    <server host="localhost" name="demo-server">
        ....
    </server>
....

After talking with Taylor it was decided that "host" should default to "%i" and the localhost -> %i translation should be eliminated.  Now if someone puts in "localhost" it will actually be localhost.
