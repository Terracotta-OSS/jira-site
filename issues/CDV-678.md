## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In Java 1.6, LinkedList now supports the Deque (double-ended queue) interface, which adds new mutator methods for adding/removing to both ends of the queue and treating it like a stack.  These methods all need to be logically instrumented in BootjarTool.addInstrumentedJavaUtilCollection().

Previous issue on adding new methods in 1.5 for Queue, should help knowing where to add tests.
