## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Forum:  http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/818.page

I tested with code below using java/dso-java and saw differences as well.  


import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
 
public class IteratorTest
 \{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  \{
    int num = 10000000;
    String val = "";
    Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<Integer, String>();
    
    for ( int i =0 ; i < num; i ++ )
    {
      map.put(i, val);
    }
    
    long begin = System.currentTimeMillis();
    
    for ( Integer s : map.keySet() )
    {
    }
    
    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
    System.out.println("Time: " + (end-begin));
  \}
 \}

The program above actually uses 10x the number of entries as the forum.  I saw about 2x slowdown with 1M, but with 10M (above) I see:

$ java -Xms512m -Xmx512m -cp bin IteratorTest
Time: 941

$ dso-java.sh -Xms512m -Xmx512m -cp bin IteratorTest
Time: 22829

So, about 20x slowdown.  Note nothing is being clustered here, just using the instrumented version of HashMap on an unclustered map.  We're certainly doing checks as to whether $\_\_tc\_MANAGED is null and stuff like that during iteration.  Seems like more overhead than I would expect though.
