## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There are many SRAs that are captured but SVT doesnt graph them. For example l2 transaction sequencer, cachemanager events, vm gc etc. It will be nice to graph all these as they are very important datapoints

This requires PM input on which additional stats to gather, probably with Field and QA input.
