## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The javadoc for RMICachePeer.getElements states the following:

"@return a list of Elements. If an element was not found or null, it will not be in the list."

However, the code does this:

        if (keys == null) {
            return new ArrayList();
        }
        List elements = new ArrayList();
        for (int i = 0; i < keys.size(); i++) {
            Serializable key = (Serializable) keys.get(i);
            Element element = cache.getQuiet(key);
            elements.add(element);
        }
        return elements;

Hence because getQuiet can return null (e.g. for expired elements), the getElements method can return a List containing nulls.  Should be a trivial fix if the javadoc reflects the current intention... although it would be worth considering whether the RMIBootstrapCacheLoader should be fetching keys for expired elements in the first place, since I don't think it has a means of fetching such elements anyway, nor a use for them.

Thanks,
