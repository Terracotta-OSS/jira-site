## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The "providerURL" configuration attribute is mandatory. It should be optional and, in case it isn't defined, it'll use the default provider URL, which is the running application server itself.

We need this because in our company we can't make this infrastructure configuration (application server's URLs) inside the application and the JMS server is the application server itself.

I've developed a patch for this feature and it's running fine in a clustered Weblogic AS 10.3. The code is attached.

I went ahead and made the change myself. Just check to see if providerURL is null and if it is, don't pass it to the intialContext. Essentially, the behavior varies amongst MQ implementations but as far as I know ActiveMQ and OracleAQ (at least) will fill a default in itself if one is not provided. 

I've deployed this code on weblogic 10.3 and it works well.

Assigning these issues to Greg, so that he can decide what to do with them.
