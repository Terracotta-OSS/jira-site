## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently when a client connects, the server prints the following to the logs:

2008-12-11 16:53:26,451 [WorkerThread(client\_handshake\_stage,0)] INFO com.tc.objectserver.handshakemanager.Ser
verClientHandshakeManager - Client connected ClientID[0]

Can we adjust this message to say:

2008-12-11 16:53:26,451 [WorkerThread(client\_handshake\_stage,0)] INFO com.tc.objectserver.handshakemanager.Ser
verClientHandshakeManager - Client connected ClientID[0] (remote=xx.xx.xx.xx:yyyy)

where xx.xx.xx.xx is ip address and yyyy is port?

Also, please add this output message to the console logger so these events are visible on the console.
