## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I debug Tomcat with TC instrumentation inside Eclipse I lose the ability to see fields in my instrumented class. I get various $\_\_tc\_MANAGED fields instead of the underlying fields in the code.

The fields are not there at all? Or you can't "see" their true values (ie. they are are null or something?)

I'm gave more info about this with Eugene. It turns out that private fields are being made static. This was preventing seeing debug info unless you enable showing static fields in the Eclipse debugger. It also turns out that I'm getting null values on these fields on restart (probably because the fields are treated as static hence not being saved?)

cool - that clearly looks like a DSO bug. Unless you happen to have some other bytecode processing stuff in that VM?? If you run trunk you also add -Dtc.classloader.writeToDisk.initial=true to see the bytecode right before we touch it (if the fields are already static before then, then someone else is causing the prob)

This is on a VM with no other bytecode weaving, but when I get the trunk build working I'll run with that -D option.

It turned out the issue was that Tomcat wasn't redeploying modified code so TC was instrumenting old code in a different format. Sorry for my mistake in not cleaning things thoroughly enough.

no prob -- just to be sure, you did have a version of that class where all those fields were static at one point in time?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Yes I did have such a class. I refactored it so Terracotta would know the fields were owned by an instance.

this is a false alarm
