## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The persistent feature is very useful, but causes troubles
when you want to store objects with properties 
belonging to a referential.

For instance :

// Property class
class SampleProperty implements Serializable
\{
   ... (set of serializable properties)
\}

// Class that MUST contains all instances of 
SampleProperty
class PropertyReferential
\{
   ... 
\}

// Class of object to store in a persistent cache
class ObjectToCache implements Serializable
\{
 SampleProperty m\_prop1;
 ... other properties
\}

When you directly create ObjectToCache, you can 
control that all m\_prop1 properties
are belonging to the PropertyReferential.

But when you unserialize an ObjectToCache instance,
the SampleProperty m\_prop1 is not automaticaly added 
to the PropertyReferential ...

To enable this, whe should replace the 
ObjectInputStream in the 
net.sf.ehcache.store.DiskStore.java class by a "Custom" 
ObjectInputStream
that handles properly the created objects.

I should suggest an optionnaly method based 
on "ClassForName" that's allow use
of a Custom ObjectInputStream instead of the 
ObjectInputStream.

Thanks.
