Adding mail thread:

Yeah, I can see where that would be a problem. We would need some sort of pattern or magic naming convention
to make it work

This is a problem if we allow a cacheDecoratorFactory at the defaultCache level, as all the 'cache' defined in the config will share the same name for the decorated cache.

At the least, we can support expanding the cache name which the decorator is decorating. Something like:

<defaultCache maxElementsInMemory="0" eternal="true">
<cacheDecoratorFactory
class="net.sf.ehcache.constructs.nonstop.NonStopCacheDecoratorFactory"
properties="name=$\{cacheName\}-nonstopcache, timeoutMillis=13000, timeoutBehavior=noop" />
</defaultCache>

As the cacheName will be unique, the expanded name for the decorated cache will also be unique automatically.

Assigning back.
Need to decide what approach to take.
Another approach is also we can make assumptions that whatever name is in the defaultCache "name" property, it will be appended to the name of the cache.

With config mentioned in the jira, following line is logged if nonStopCache is working.


```
 2010-10-19 20:44:22,171 INFO main [net.sf.ehcache.constructs.nonstop.NonStopCacheConfigImpl] - No value was specified for key 'immediateTimeout'. Using default value - 'true'
```


Verified in ehcache-core 2.3.0 & tim-ehcache-2.x-1.6.1.
Doesnt work for ehcache-core 2.2.0 & tim-ehcache-2.x-1.6.0
