## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Cache transactions to insure cache coherency across nodes  are extremely important when quality of the data really matters.

I would like to see support for READ\_COMMITTED and SERIALIZABLE transactions to say the least.

Also, plugging into JTA could be beneficial, although I don't see it to be critical and would do it only if performance is not sacrificed.

Hi

I had a conversation with someone from JavaOne who wanted this feature. Is that you. I was hoping for a patch.
