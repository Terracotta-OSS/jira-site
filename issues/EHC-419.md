Attached some more runs from 1.6.2 and 1.7.

I did some more runs of this on 1.6.2 and 1.7.  What I see is that:

a) The values on each test vary significantly (1.6.2 puts: 0.6 to 2.5 and 1.7: 1.1 to 2.9 for example).  Enough that I don't really trust these numbers very far. 
b) Assuming you believe the numbers, in most cases the 1.7 times are better.  put() looks slower in the first two tests but faster in the third.  remove[All] looks slower in the first and third test but faster in the second.  Given that you added synchronization to put(), I wouldn't be surprised that it's slower.  
c) The 1.7 runs are showing the concurrency bug from EHC-427 but I think I know the fix for that.  Not sure whether that would affect the results - I think it only affects the clear() calls.

In general, I don't trust these tests enough to really tell me anything specific.  If I do believe them, they look mostly better except for \*maybe\* put, but I expect that to be slower.  I don't think this is worth spending more time on right now.

updated perf data - threw out the second run on 1.6.2 as it looked way high and added a new second and third run.

1.7.x is about 70% slower on this test than 1.6.2

History of this Test

This test has been used as the principal benchmark for ehcache for many years. There may be better tests, but this
is the one we have comparative data for.

In 1.5 this test the get time used to be 1.2ms!. i.e. 1200 versus our current .007 in 1.6.2 and .013 in 1.7.x.

The JBoss Cache performance test suite showed a similar speed up, so this test is not rubbish.

My Concern

I have a number of concerns:

1. This is a real regression. I suspect the extra work being done to collect sampling statistics is the cause.
2. The performance speedup was very hard fought for. I do not want to give it up.

2. The performance speedup was very hard fought for. I do not want to give it up.
3. We need to ensure we compare well with competitors. The JBossCache test is the one I have published numbers under. We do not want to be slower than Infinispan etc.
4. We need to remain competitive with roll your own solutions based on CHM
