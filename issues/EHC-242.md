## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We use multiple databases and prefix our caches using the hibernate.cache.region\1prefix property. I was looking for a quick way to clear all caches for a specific region and this is what I came up with. It'd be nice to see this added to the CacheManager object, as I'm sure a number of people could use it.



   public void clearCacheByRegionPrefix(String regionPrefix) {

        String[] cacheNames = getCacheNames();
        for (int i = 0; i < cacheNames.length; i++) {
            String cacheName = cacheNames[i];
            if (cacheName.startsWith(regionPrefix)) {
                Ehcache cache = cacheManager.getEhcache(cacheName);
                cache.removeAll();
        }

Look into whether we should use a pattern and also should this go in the operations console.

The current impl. matches other CacheManager behaviors, but I think it might require some reviewing: returning silently on null or empty string prefix

Verified with 

product-name    = Ehcache Core
version         = 1.7.2
built-by        = cruise
build-jdk       = 1.6.0\117
build-time      = 2009-12-12 03:48:03
build-revision  = 1516

Wrote a small test:

Putting 10 elements in all three caches: dummy, dummyTwo, NotDummy
dummy:10
dummyTwo:10
NotDummy:10

Clearing cache starting with dummy
dummy:0
dummyTwo:0
NotDummy:10
