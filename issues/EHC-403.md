No, I'm slightly hesitant about doing this though - I'll look into possible solutions and post back with some ideas.

An exact fix requires using a deterministic evictor. See http://ehcache.org/documentation/hibernate.html#FAQ where this issue is discussed in detail.

I'm not going to fix this... This is a completely non-fatal condition that should happen very rarely in current Ehcache.  It's even mentioned in the FAQ as Greg indicates.  If customers start complaining we can re-open or a file a new item.
