## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://www.sencha.com/forum/showthread.php?78788-OPEN-197-3.0.0-svn-5208-this.swf.setDataprovider-is-not-a-function

On Firefox and Chrome (any WebKit based browser) there is a bug with embedded components being re-initialized as a result of being made visible.  During that unnecessary re-initialization, the embedded component cannot be operated on in a normal fashion. Each time you select a tab in the monitor app, that page's data is refreshed asynchronously. Selecting the Charts tab, with just the right timing, causes JavaScript errors.

Symptom: you select the Charts tab and the chart component is blank and will stay blank regardless of which CacheManager/Cache/Statistic is selected in the drop-down fields.

Workaround: refresh the monitor app using the browsers refresh control or hit RETURN in the URL field containing the monitor app's address. However, this doesn't solve the problem for very long.

One thing that can be done is to specifically not allow the graphs data to be updated until we know the Chart control is fully re-initialized. Not sure how to go about doing that.
