## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm not sure why the Configurator \1needs\1 to have a
disk cache path of "/tmp", but that assertion will
\1never\1 pass on a windows machine.

This patch changes the disk cache path from needing to
be "/tmp" ot checking that the supplied path name
exists as a file, is a directory, and can be read from
and written to.

I can't figure out how to get NetBeans to pass "-u" to
diff, so this patch is a "context" diff, not a
"unified" one; I hope that's okay.

I changed ConfiguratorTest to use java.io.tmpdir. This maps to whatever 
the temporary directory is on your system. 

        //Check disk path  <diskStore path="/tmp"/>
        
assertEquals(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"), 
configuration.getDiskCachePath());
