## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The functions performed by the archive-tool.sh and backup-data.sh scripts in the terracotta distribution do not cover the index files backing ehcache search. 

The only current workaround is to start a passive terracotta server and let it synchronize with the active server. When that is complete and the server shutdown the resulting data and index files are suitable backup.
