## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The upload command could allow users to upload their TIMs and have it become available as an item in the tim-get tool's list command.
Users wont need to have their projects listed in our Forge (which could be a very slow process) to make their TIMs available.

Here's a sketch of how the upload command will work:

   $ ./tim-get upload tim-foobar.jar --developer-id=xxx --password=xxx

If successful will upload tim-foobar.jar in a way station, and will be picked up by the tim-get tool index publisher.
To be successful, the user must have a developer-id (that TC issued after registration) and has supplied the correct password for their account.

We could do additional processing to qualify an uploaded jar. For example:
- the TIM jar must be a config only TIM
- the symbolicName of the TIM must start-with the user's registered groupId
- the developerId must be valid
- the password paired with the developerId must be valid
- manifest attributes (like vendor name, copyright, etc) matches the users registration
