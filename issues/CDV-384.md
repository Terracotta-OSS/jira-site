## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There are some instrumentation config that will always be (or currently be) required, as well as some terracotta configuration that doesn't have a home yet or does not warrant (yet) a config-bundle all its own. This module could house/create these configurations. This module will always be installed and started.

Here are some of the configuration that it should create (very likely more):
- exclusion of obfuscated classes (com.sun.crypto.provider..\1, etc)
- specify permanent excludes
- include javax.swing model classes (eg: javax.swing.AbstractListModel) 
- include java.awt model classes
- etc.

We could add a terracotta.xml file in modules-common config bundle instead of creating a new one for this purpose.

This is completed. There more configs that we can pull out of stdcfghelper, but we should step back and formulate a way to organize and group these configurations (beyond the obvious 3rd party TC configs)

Hung as you have been involved in testing the Forge in the early stages can you verify that these issues are resolved? thanks
