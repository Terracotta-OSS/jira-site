## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm in the same environment described in CDV-1648. The quartz and ehcache integrations try to connect many times and eventually (and the number of retries can be 10 to over 100, to never) before being connecting successfully. Logs from client and server are attached. 

In a different app server, I'm using the latest version of terracotta sessions (tomcat 6) and it successfully connects to the server on the first attempt.

Same resolution as CDV-1648. We're using the latest version of the NewRelic java agent (2.14.0) which seems to mess around with outgoing requests from the application (eg. to fetch configuration from the TC server). There are no issues with the older version of NewRelic that we were using (2.12.0). I'll follow up with NewRelic.
