Before I start doing this, I'd like to get the exact wording and possible information that should be displayed, and where. Maybe PM can chime in on this?

My suggestion is that we add a boxed out label / button in a smaller perhaps italicized font to the right of (or right under) the logos that either says
"Valid license key detected. Licensed for production usage"
or
"NO valid license key detected. This software is NOT licensed 
for production usage. Click \_here\_ to find out more about
the benefits of a full license and how to get one"
and link that to a page on terracotta.org named 
http://terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Ehcache+Monitor+License

Verified that the moniotr server is started with  trial license or  no license key,
License info is displayed in the monitor GUI webpage
"No valid license key detected. This software is NOT licensed for production 
usage. Click here to find out more about the benefits of a full license and 
How to get one."
link the message, the Page not found appears  EHC-534

When the server is started with commerical license,
License info is displayed in the monitor GUI webpage
"Valid license key detected. Licensed for production usage."

When the server is started with expired licesne
message dialog pops up indicating that the license expired.
