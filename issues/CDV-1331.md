## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Even when using Maven you might wish to use tim-get to update your tc-config but there is no way to run tim-get via Maven.

Gary mentioned this might be useful for doing something tim-get upgrade but I think it's mostly overlapping functionality with what maven already does.  Given the effort involved I'm not super-enthusiastic about this one.

I guess the real questions is "are TIM versions useful at all?"  This issue should be reorganized under an umbrella issue titled "Make all kit script functionality available via tc-maven-plugin."
