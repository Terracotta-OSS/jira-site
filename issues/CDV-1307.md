## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If I configure an evictable map with a TTI of 1 second I don't believe the timestamp will ever be updated even though an entry has been accessed. To reproduce write a program that adds a single to a map with TTI=1. Then repeatedly get() an item for more than 1 second. The entry will [unexpectedly] expire

Actually TTI = 2 might not work either :-)

The problem is as time is not continuous, the least value of tti we can support is leastCount + 1.
Fixed it by handling the special case for tti=1.
In this case, when updating the lastAccessedTime (at time usedAtTime), the value for lastAccessedTime is updated to (usedAtTime + 1). This is effectively equivalent to making tti=2.

For tti=2 case, updated shouldUpdateIdleTimer() to handle boundary case when timeSinceUsed == halfWayTTI. Earlier shouldUpdateIdleTimer(..) returned true only when timeSinceUsed > halfWayTTI, now it checks for timeSinceUsed >= halfWayTTI

Fixed in trunk rev-17016
tc-3.1 branch rev-17017

unable to verify the fix, tim-map-evictor moved as tim-distributed-cache.
