## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Even trying to do this via jconsole is not user-friendly because the classes aren't generally available. The DevConsole also would benefit from this because it also doesn't have the ehcache classes.

Further, the DevConsole should be changed to not let the user do this in the first place.
