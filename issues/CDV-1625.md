## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We've been using Terracotta for distributed data sharing, and we now would like to replace an activeMQ DB persistent queue (because of awful performance) by a Terracotta queue.
Our use case involve several producers and consumers. We would like to have a transactional dequeue, I mean a lock shall be granted on an item to a consumer but dequeue shall be effective only when the consumer has completed its task. Of course several consumers shall be able to access this queue and to lock different items.
A simple implementation would be to dequeue and enqueue in case of failure, but we can't afford re-enqueue an item because of time constraint. 

klalithr said : 
However, having said that "transactional dequeue" behavior can be implemented with a bit of custom logic using toolkit locks and maps - like you have also suggested.

We are not a replacement for a JMS queue. Not sure we want to tell this customer that it is okay to do this.
