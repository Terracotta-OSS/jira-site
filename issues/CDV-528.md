## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

TreeSet in 1.6 implements NavigableSet<E>  (new in 1.6) which is not supported.

Since we claim to support TreeSet, we should also support NavigableSet<E>. 

The same is true for NavigableMap for TreeMap

I think supported these additional methods is pretty straightlforward. Since we claim to support these types, I'd think getting this fixes would be higher priority than types that completely new (and currently unsupported -- CDV-527). LOE: 1-2 weeks
