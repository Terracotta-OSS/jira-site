## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

each find operation scrolls the window so the found result is at the bottom.


many times, you want to see the surrounding text, so it means after each find you need to scroll up to see the surrounding text.  to optimize this process it would be helpful if after the result is found, the found result is centered within the window.
