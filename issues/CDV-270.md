## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When specifying a custom module, the common-1.0 module cannot be loaded. The repository used is
the modules/ directory inside the eclipse plugin, which doesn't exist. 

This may be documented somewhere, but it should work out of the box; took me a while to figure out why this was
happening; had to turn up debug logging to see why the module couldn't be found.
Also, I didn't specify that module at all, just my custom module. When you do not specify a module at all,
the common module isn't loaded. When you specify 1 module, the common module will be loaded too.

Tested with rev 4845, all the modules exists in the eclipse plugin

1. Install the eclipse plugin
2. Go to eclipse\plugins\org.terracotta.dso\_2.4.1.r4845\_v20070806\modules

Working as expected, closing this issue
