## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think it is very disturbing to have 2 methods to add a Cache to a cacheManager: one that takes an instance of Cache, the other of Ehcache when Cache implements Ehcache.
Besides, I think these two methods have been doing the same for a long time already (it already did in some weird ways before the datastructure unification of both maps holding mappings of name to Ehcache or Cache instances)
