## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The ehcache-server 0.9 release cannot be promoted to Maven Central because the POM contains references to other Maven repositories, which is in violation of Maven Central policy.  In order to promote to Maven Central, the <repositories> element must be removed from the POM.  However, there are dependencies declared in the POM that are not available on Maven Central, so this situation must be resolved first.

also a missing artifact that's not available anywhere that we know of

Missing:
----------
1) javax.xml.crypto:xmldsig:jar:1.0

  Try downloading the file manually from the project website.

  Then, install it using the command:       mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.xml.crypto -DartifactId=xmldsig -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file

  Alternatively, if you host your own repository you can deploy the file there:       mvn deploy:deploy-file -DgroupId=javax.xml.crypto -DartifactId=xmldsig -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=/path/to/file -Durl=[url] -DrepositoryId=[id]

  Path to dependency:       1) net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-server:war:0.9-SNAPSHOT
      2) com.sun.xml.wss:xws-security:jar:3.0
      3) javax.xml.crypto:xmldsig:jar:1.0

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The Sun Maven jars are being added to Maven central under contract by Sonatype. This is expected to be completed the week starting 22 March 2010. When that is done we can remove our repository declarations as they will no longer be needed.
