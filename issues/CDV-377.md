I think we should upgrade since there are many bugs that were fixed and also it is easier to get support for the latest version.

Currently we are using 3.2.23 and latest version is 3.2.44.
As Saravan said, many fixes. We should upgrade.

Manually tried out 3.2.44 locally. It looks fine with
my latest test ManagedObjectPersistorImplTest and SleepycatColectionsTest, SleeycatMapStoreTest,
SleepycatSequenceTest, SleepycatSerializationTest.
