## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

- I downloaded the examinator standalone package fresh for the first time
- ran tim-get.sh install --all
- cd /usr/local/examinator-1.0.4
- bin/startCluster.sh

Got JETTY\_HOME not found error.  When I exported the JETTY\_HOME variable into my environment, startCluster.sh worked fine.

Here's my console output:

2009-02-25 14:54:00,461 FATAL - BootJarTool: Unable to resolve TIM file for tim-jetty-6.1 version 1.1.3 (group-id: org.terracotta.modules)

   Attempted to resolve the TIM using the following descriptors:

      groupId: org.terracotta.modules
      name   : tim-jetty-6.1
      version: 1.1.3

   Expected the TIM's filename to be:

      tim-jetty-6.1-1.1.3.jar

   Expected these attributes to be in the manifest:

      Bundle-SymbolicName: org.terracotta.modules.tim-jetty-6.1
      Bundle-Version     : 1.1.3

   Searched using the following repositories:

      + /usr/local/terracotta-2.7.3-ee/modules
      
   Tried to resolve the jar file using the following paths:

      + /usr/local/terracotta-2.7.3-ee/modules/org/terracotta/modules/tim-jetty-6.1/1.1.3/tim-jetty-6.1-1.1.3.jar
      + /usr/local/terracotta-2.7.3-ee/modules/tim-jetty-6.1-1.1.3.jar
      
   If the jar file exists and is in one of the paths listed above, make sure that the Bundle-SymbolicName and
   Bundle-Version attribute in its manifest matches the ones that the resolver expects.

   If you do not have this particular TIM or any of its dependencies installed, try using the tim-get tool's 
   'install' command:

      $ tim-get.sh install tim-jetty-6.1 1.1.3 org.terracotta.modules

   You can also use the tool's 'list' command to see if it's actually available:

      $ tim-get.sh list tim-jetty-6.1   # list anything that has 'tim-jetty-6.1' in it's name
      $ tim-get.sh list                 # or, list everything that is available

   For more information on how to use the tim-get tool, invoke:

      $ tim-get.sh help

Can you reproduce this issue?  I know Orion got it to work eventually but we should figure out if we need to update docs or something.

check in with Orion to get details of the issue as well.

Can't reproduce this, the closest I get is if the tim-get install had problems and the tim-jetty is actually missing
