In the last meeting we had with project mgmt, we decided not to rush into doing this as we are thinking of enhancing the config system anyways. Taylor will be adding more info on the details we discussed.

Now tc.properties are settable thru config. Once we do the config system redesign, we will revisit this. We will track it as separate jiras then.
