## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

On step six (of seven), when the installer tries to create the shortcuts, IzPack throws an error, and nothing happens.  Repeated attempts to hit "next" are met with no success, just more stack traces.  This is probably (certainly?) an IzPack bug, but hey, I hit it when using the TC installer.  :)

Here's the stack:
C:\Users\michaella\Downloads>java -jar terracotta-3.0.1-installer.jar
could not create shortcut instance
java.lang.Exception: error loading library
java.lang.Exception: can't locate library

I've attached screenshots of steps five and six, for posterity.

Screenshots of TC install - steps 5 (okay) and 6 (not so much).

Oh, and this doesn't impact functionality - I can hit "quit" and start things up manually.  (Once I figure out what scripts to run, that is.)

Windows 7 is in RC mode for testing. Release expected October 2009.  I doubt that IzPack is tested on it. I know for sure that Terracotta is not:)

Workaround is to use the generic kit, rather than the IzPack installer.
