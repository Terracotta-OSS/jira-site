## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Pre-commit methods are intended to be called on all configured objects before they are added to the clustered heap.  The current implementation only calls the pre-create method of the root object when a graph of objects is added.  For example if I add an ArrayList of objects to the clustered heap only the pre-commit hook of the list would be called, and not the pre-commit method of any of the objects in the list.
