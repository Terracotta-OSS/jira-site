## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi,

I possibly ran into a memory leak issue that appears when xa\_strict mode is used.

Tested configurations:
a.) standalone: Grails 2.0.1 (which uses Hibernate 3.6.7) with JOTM
b.) Grails 2.0.1 app inside Glassfish 3.1.2 (no clustering)

hibernate.cache.use\_second\_level\_cache = true
hibernate.cache.use\_query\_cache = true
hibernate.cache.region.factory\_class = 'net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory'

Symptoms:
heap usage increases slowly
when max. heap space is reached, at first the VM is doing permanent GC (100% cpu usage) than runs into out of memory

I didn't have the time to debug the source in order to find the source of the problem.
What I discovered is that Hibernate SessionImpl objects accumulate in the heap (I used jvisualvm for that).
Each time a JTA transaction is used, SessionImpl instances are left over.
This happens only, if transactionalMode in ehcache.xml is set to xa\_strict, but it disappears once you set it to xa.

It should be pretty easy to reproduce the problem.
If absolutely necessary, I can provide a test-case.

Regards
Markus

I missed something:

hibernate.transaction.factory\_class = 'org.hibernate.transaction.JTATransactionFactory'

For standalone configuration:
hibernate.transaction.manager\_lookup\_class = 'org.hibernate.transaction.JOTMTransactionManagerLookup'
For Glassfish configuration:
hibernate.transaction.manager\_lookup\_class = 'org.hibernate.transaction.SunONETransactionManagerLookup'

And: of course did manual GCs to check whether or not the SessionImpl instances are released from memory.

I'm sending to you, only because it says Hibernate. Not sure if I should send to Ludovic to look at from JTA side.

Let me know if I should re-assign

Looks like this is comparable to http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/6146.page 
I think this should remain 2.5.2... Assigned to Ludovic who has a patch ready

I've committed a fix for the original forum bug in trunk (r5431). We should now instruct the bug reporter to try the latest nightly build and see if that helps.

Ludovic can you merge to the RC branch - march-madness-rc, as well as 2.5.x?

We don' t have nightly builds released on the website for trunk
feed://download.terracotta.org/rss/terracotta-core.rss

He will need to take a snapshot 


thanks
