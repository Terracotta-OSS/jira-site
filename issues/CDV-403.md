## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi All,

I don't if JMX is the right place to log on this. But anyway.

In administrator console, once I do zoom in or zoom out, the charts freeze. Till I do automatic scale.

Should it behave this way ?

Cordially,

I believe the point is that if you've focused in on some part of the graph, you don't want is scrolling away.
