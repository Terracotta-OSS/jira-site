## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

we need to search the cache by values for our project. But on analysis, we found that we have only .eq() method to search in cache. But while testing we found that this method does case insensitive search.
Please confirm if we can consider that eq() method is doing an case insensitive search.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

All string operators in Ehcache search are case insensitive. This is evident from examining code in {{net.sf.ehcache.search.expression.EqualTo}}
