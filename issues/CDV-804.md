## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If one uses a context.xml in the conf directory for tomcat like so:

  <Context cookies="false" crossContext="true"></Context>

AND TC sessions are being used, we fail to honor this and end up writing cookies. This can be worked around using the session.cookie.enabled=false tc.property to force cookies to be disabled
