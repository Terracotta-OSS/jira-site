## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Today if  I want to see which client is pegging the CPU or which clients are making any transactions, I need to expand each node for each client and look  the graph.

It will be nice if I can have a view where I can either choose all the clients or a list of clients and see all the graphs in the same view. Obviously the easiest way to do this is to have  different colored graph for each client and use the same layout which is probably ok for a small set of clients (<8)

Another approach would be is to create a bar graph for each client and show only the instantaneous values at regular intervals. Then if one client is of interest one could always go the detailed view for that client and see the histogram.

Are you using OSS or EE kit?  EE kit has a summary view of clients and servers in one page.

Just check EE admin console and to my excitement it does have an unified view. These are a list of improvements I could like to have.

1) ability to scroll. I tried connecting 12 clients and the real estate became smaller and smaller. would be nice to have it scroll
2) Ability to graph the rest of the items, pending transactions, faults, flushes etc.
