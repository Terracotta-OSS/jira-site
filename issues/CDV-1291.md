## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If you increase the NUM\_FIELDS constant in ManyFieldsTest things should start exploding due to method body length violations. 

There are problems in both the server and client generated classes for this. Basically the methods that iterate over all fields start to exceed the 64k method length.

We might also want to look out for generated methods (these and others) that exceed 8000 bytes as these won't be compiled by Hotspot by default (you can raise this threshold -XX:HugeMethodLimit=<xxx> but its generally speaking a stupid idea - leads to HotSpot crashes due to running out of resources).
