## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Wraps a Cache object with a Queue so that objects can be added and removed in order, without referencing a key.  Is useful for a WriteBehindCache implementation.

Attached is Eclipse project directory.  Just set a reference to: ehcache-1.6.0-beta3-sources.jar to compile.

Also included is a tester class, to test whether a specified class is actually serializable.
