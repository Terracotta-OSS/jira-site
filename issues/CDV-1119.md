<div markdown="1" class="comment">

One snag is the somewhat bizarre locking that the session manager wants to do (ie. the lock is held longer than just the get()/put() operations on the map). I suppose we could continue to do that locking in addition to the locks created in the CSM but I don't really like that since it would translate to 2x the number of locks

Also use Tim Map evictor in sessions as well

Presumably Chris's locking changes in CSM (to allow exposed lock for longer lock scope) will help address the issue Tim mentioned earlier?

Need to evaluate how well evictor works (performance-wise) in comparison to existing session eviction.

some thoughts on what it might take to get this happen (ie. what gaps are still there)
