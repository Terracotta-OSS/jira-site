## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently entering the command 'tim-get.sh info tim-svt' (or using tim-get.bat in Windows) brings up info as expected, but the configuration section looks something like this:

    Configuration:

       <modules>
          <module name="tim-svt" version="1.1.0-SNAPSHOT" />
       </modules>

This is wrong -- no configuration is required for tim-svt. The configuration section should say 'No configuration required.'



</div>
