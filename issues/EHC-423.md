## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Bug EHC-406 has been accidentally marked as duplicate but has not been fixed:
The pom of net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core:1.6.2 refers to the parent pom net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-parent:2.0-SNAPSHOT which forces all users to use the snapshot repository. A user of a released version should never need to access the snapshot repository. Neither should a release refer to a parent pom with a higher version than the component itself.
The pom net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core:1.6.2 should either not refer to any parent pom or refer a parent pom with a version like 1.6.x or 1.6.2 but most important one that is located in the release repository.
Here is the link to the broken pom: http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-releases/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache-core/1.6.2/ehcache-core-1.6.2.pom
IMPORTANT: All the poms of all the modules have to be fixed!
Please excuse that I post this bug again. But it caues a failed build in our project and I don't want to kick ehcache out because of this.

I see what happened. 

Ehcache has actually been in the core directory for a while. In 1.7, we acknowledged this by changing its artifact id to ehcache-core. ehcache then becomes an aggregate, a bit like an all, which will contain commonly combined modules. 

The 1.6.2 slipped out while the move to Terracotta based build environments were going on.

The old bug redeployed ehcache-1.6.2 with the pom fixed. This new one deploys ehcache-core-1.6.2 with the pom fixed, even though this latter one was never a release. Never mind, it is now, and Maven now works for it.

BTW, yesterday we put out ehcache-core-1.7.0, which contains a handful of bug fixes to 1.6.2.

I will leave this open until you confirm it is working for you.
