## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Improve lock debugging/tuning capabilities - provide visibility into:
1. Per JVM Monitors
2. Shared JVM Monitors
3. Movement of cluster monitors across L1s (which L1 currently has it, which L1s are requesting it)
4. Lock acquisition time
5. Lock recall time.
6. When lock was last recalled, from whcih L1.

7. Easier DeadLock Detection tools.
8. Ability to turn off auto lock-escalation and instead throw an exception when escalation occurs ?
