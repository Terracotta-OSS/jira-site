## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently Ehcache provide annoatation support only for spring based projects. However annotation support can be extended to non-spring projects as well. I have implemented this in my sample project. \

Hi, 

I am proposing to extend Ehcache's annotation support for Sping to non-spring implementations as well. 

Currently Ehcache's @Cacehable annotation is only available for Spring. 

I have built my own annotation for Ehcache which can be used for non Spring classes as well. 

Regards,

Vikram

We don't maintain that annotation project. Probably best seen with them...
