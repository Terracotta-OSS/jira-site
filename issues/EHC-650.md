## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The copy-on-read flag is set too late on the Terracotta config, resulting in the store being misconfigured.
This can be worked around by setting copyOnRead="true" to the <terracotta /> of the XA cache manually

This should be the topic of another JIRA, but we could consider making copyOnRead a dynamic (and maybe even local/transient) property). This might be what people want and it would have avoided this bug too :-)

Thought this would justify another question I asked myself earlier today.
Where do I best force the store to be copyOnRead if the cache is configured to be transactional... I was thinking whether that should not be state/decisions taken in the config itself. Haven't looked any further if something comparable had been done before, but I'll be asking myself the question again soon I think!

I dunno really the best place. The way the code is right now seems pretty straightfoward the setting of copyOnRead to true is located along with the creation of the XA store. Of course that doesn't work, but the placement seems reasonable
