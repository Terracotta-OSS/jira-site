## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There is more than one problem here. 

The first is that trying to load the "SHA" message digest in SerialVersionUIDAdder ends up calling back into itself (since the implementation classes are loaded by the extension loader if I recall correctly). Anyway, the resullt is StackOverflow. 

I started working on a solution that tries to prevent cycles which gets one further, but then I get a unexplained VM exit (at least when I try to start WAS). Excluding "org.eclipse.osgi..\1" gets rid of the problem, but that doesn't narrow it down too far. I'm going to attach the code just for good measure. There is also an issue with the System.err.println() in AbstractClassDumper that manifests under Websphere AS since it is trying to swap out System.out at some point in time.

The configurator was failing because of this, and now it seems to work ok.  The System.out.println() is not really an issue, it just goes to the WAS log instead of the console -- if this becomes a problem for someone (I seriously doubt it) we can address it then.
