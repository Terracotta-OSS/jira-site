## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1467.page#8966

The statistics store couldn't be opened at 
'c:\terracotta\server-statistics'. 
The CVT gathering system will not be active for this node. 

A common reason for this is that you're launching several Terracotta clients or 
servers on the same machine. The default directory for the statistics store 
uses the IP address of the machine that it runs on as the identifier. 
When several clients are being executed on the same machine, a typical solution 
to properly separate these directories is by using a JVM property at startup 
that is unique for each client. 

For example: 
dso-java.sh -Dnode=node1 your.main.Class 

You can then adapt the tc-config.xml file so that this JVM property is picked 
up when the statistics directory is configured by using %(node) in the 
statistics path.
