## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Configurator support works reasonably well for Linux in a very simple case, but it needs further work to support other platforms and will probably only work on Linux with a very simple WebSphere configuration.  It has not been tested with more complex WebSphere deployments and I worry that without this testing it may cause frustration rather than make things easier.  I would vote to postpone configurator support until the stable2 release.

Commented out, should be pretty easy to add back in when we are ready.
