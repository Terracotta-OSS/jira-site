## Description

Unable to recreate it (using OS X and Windows installation)

Tim Eck's IDE/environment is likely partly to blame:
- The plugin was installed under a directory other than the top-level directory for plugins in Eclipse. 
   It was installed under the YourKit plugin's plugin directory.
- The location of the plugin was deep enough, that it probably exceeded the allowed length for a path name in Windows - this caused the Terracotta plugin to not find the module (if specified in tc-config), or emit the said warnings if no modules were specified.

A better error message could help, but  given that plugin was installed in the wrong location in the first place, this might not be necessary.
