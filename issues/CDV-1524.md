## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

With the 3.4.0 release we pushed out tim-ehcache-2.x-1.6.1. Unfortunately tim-get doesn't filter based on transitive dependencies it seems. This new tim-ehcache-2.x depends on terracotta-toolkit-1.1 and there is no version of that is compatible with TC core 3.3.0. 

Tim-get will tell you 1.6.1 of tim-ehcache-2.x is available but will not be able to install it. 

There is a workaround, just tell tim-get to explicitly get 1.6.0, but we should fix tim-get to be smarter in this case
