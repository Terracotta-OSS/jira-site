## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Again, feels like this has been discussed before:

Often time the Object graph displayed within the Admin Console could be deep and could include a large number of entries in a collection. Examining such large collections for specific elements/values is impossible . 

An option to dump the admin Console contents to stdout/stdeerr and/or enable search would be very useful in terms of debugging.
