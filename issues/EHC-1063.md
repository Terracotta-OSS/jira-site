## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When doing a sha1 checksum of http://www.terracotta.org/download/reflector/releases/org/terracotta/terracotta-toolkit-1.6-runtime/5.4.0/terracotta-toolkit-1.6-runtime-5.4.0.jar the result is fb794a161f0587726b5c600902c9094314d60a05
http://www.terracotta.org/download/reflector/releases/org/terracotta/terracotta-toolkit-1.6-runtime/5.4.0/terracotta-toolkit-1.6-runtime-5.4.0.jar.sha1 says 1b25e55980fb2b4758b198a7cf83d6c37736c670

Any news? This is a tad annoying as it make it more complicated to mirror (our maven repositories are set up in such way that invalid artifacts aren't mirrored). There is also the obvious integrity issue that can lead to other more annoying problems.

Same for EHC-1064

The checksums for this jar in our artifact repository are below.  Something is definitely not correct.  Potentially, we simply republish?

SHA1 - 1b25e55980fb2b4758b198a7cf83d6c37736c670
MD5 - 3f22d4f489a362c8e2295606a814d7b3
