## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The TransparencyClassAdapter will not add wrapper methods containing cluster locking code around synchronized methods in adaptable (but not portable) classes.  This means for example that the following code in an adaptable class (e.g. a subclass of a literal) cannot be autolocked:

private synchronized void method() {
  //do stuff
}

This equivalent can be made autolocked because the TransparencyCodeAdapter has no such limitation.

private void method() {
  synchronized (this) {
    //do stuff
  }
}
