## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This came from the thread at http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/625.page.  

The customer was using Jetty and Weblogic 10 with Terracotta 2.4.3.  When the AspectDefinitionBuilder attempts to load the Weblogic 9 session aspect, the following warning was seen:


AW::WARNING - could not load class [com/tc/weblogic/SessionAspect] as a resource in loader [ContextLoader@null]
### Unable to retrieve annotation data for com.tc.weblogic.SessionAspect; java.lang.NullPointerException 

It appears that an NPE is thrown during the session aspect load, presumably due to an incompatibility between the WL 9 session aspect and WL 10.  The customer was not using Weblogic session support so should be able to ignore the warning.  However, we should fix the aspect to either not load unless specifically for WL 9 or at least to avoid the NPE and subsequent warning.
