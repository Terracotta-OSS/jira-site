## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This case applies to configuring a cache and adding it to a cache manager through method calls. 

If the cache is created without a replication event listener and then added to a cache manager, creating and registering such a listener at a later point does not lead to the cache replication working. 

getCache().getCacheEventNotificationService().registerListener(cacheEventListener);

According to the source code, caches get added to replication lists based on whether they have a replication event listener. However this happens at the time a cache is added to a cache manager (CacheManager.addCacheNoCheck()). 

I believe similar behavior should be added to registerListener(cacheEventListener) method. 

Without it registration succeeds but cache replication doesn't happen. To work around this issue, after registering a replication listener the code has to make an explicit call to the cache manager's event listener registry:
            getCache().getCacheManager().getCacheManagerEventListenerRegistry().notifyCacheAdded("cacheName");
