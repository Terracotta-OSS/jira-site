## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">


```
/**
 * Puts an item into the store and the cache writer manager in an atomic operation
 * @return true if this is a new put for the key or element is null. Returns false if it was an update.
 */
boolean Store.putWithWriter()
```


CompoundStore.putWithWriter returns the opposite value-- true if update

This results in no puts being registered in the statistics for a cache using a writer.

Fixed this in trunk, will wait for it to get targeted in case it needs merging to other branches before I mark it fixed.

Since it's a bug in core we should get it out in the first dot of ehcache 2.4
