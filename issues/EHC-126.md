## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

CachingFilter.checkNoReentry() changes the name of the
Thread in order to check reentry. 
When the build page is generated, it changes the name
of all the threads to the same name: "Application
Server Thread".
It makes difficult to follow the execution path in the
logs when all the application server threads have the
same name.
checkNoReentry() should return old thread name in order
to be changed in the finally statement in buildPageInfo()

Ok

At the beginning:
String originalThreadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();

At the end in a finally()
Thread.currentThread().setName(originalThreadName);

The "Application Server Thread" was an Orion specific thread naming 
convention.

This is in ehcache-1.2.2.
