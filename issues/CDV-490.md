## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Submitted on behalf of : James Heanly at Shine Technologies.

We currently only have one client using the application of which Terracotta forms a core component. Recently, they have
been experiencing some memory problems with the Terracotta server JVM. The problem appears to be that for some reason,
the Terracotta server JVM is not freeing memory, until the point that the JVM exceeds its available memory and the
server crashes (all currently running clients therefore lose their connection to the server).

Now, I'm not entirely sure whether you are the right person to help me, or whether I should be posting my issue on the
Terracotta forum (please let me know if there is a more correct mechanism for having my queries answered).

I have attached a document that shows the memory usage (via JConsole) for the Terracotta server JVM. In my simple test
case, I have the Terracotta server running along with only one client. Now, the client is not permanently connected to
the server. We have a shell script that starts the client (via cron) every minute. The client connects to the Terracotta
server via access to the root defined in the tc-config.xml file. It then checks a database table to see if it has any
work to do (which in my test case it doesn't) and completes (the client JVM terminates).

I ran this test scenario for approximately one hour, over which time the memory usage of the Terracotta server steadily
grew. I then stopped any further execution of the client, but for some reason the servers memory usage continued to grow.

This is where my problem lies. I was expecting the memory usage of the server to at least plateau, or preferably, return
to a level somewhere around the usage at the startup of the server. What I am doing wrong? Do I need to tune the
Terracotta server garbage collection? Is there some means of more cleanly disconnecting a client from the server (ie in
our case, the server does not need to check for reconnecting clients - each client that runs is effectively treated as a
new client)?

Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

By the way, my test case was run against the latest version of Terracotta (2.4.5). I can supply source code if required.

work with Hung to get a test to recreate this.

Sorry for the delay getting back to you.  I don't think there is anything specific that we need wrt a heap dump, but I have asked our field engineering and engineering team leads to let me know if there is anything particular we need.

We look forward to getting a snapshot from you to analyze.  If you have found anything further on your end, please let me know.

You should just attach the heap dump to this bug using the file attachment procedure.

Our test that simulates this use case doesnt produce this error. Unless we either get the original application or atleast a heap dump on OOME, there is nothing else we can do here.

I have attached some sample code, as well as a chart showing the memory usage of the Terracotta server over an extended period of time.

The attached also includes some notes on the process (see README.txt)

Now that we have more info, please look into this.

Also, close the CRT issue.

I've set up a similar scenario with one client spawning every minute.

Heap dump of only live objects will be taken every 30 minutes and drop here http://fileserver/ftp/pub/users/hhuynh/dumps/

For the first hour, I noticed an 8MB increase in heap size.

The test is still running. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

After 18 hours, here's some preliminary data:

First heap snapshot taken at 6PM NOV-30:        15.5MB  (attachment first-heap.png)
Second heap snapshot taken at 12PM DEV-01: 86.9MB  (attachment second-heap.png)

Check out the delta of the two heaps with attachment delta-in-18-hours.png

Clearly there's memory leak. com.tc.stats.counter.sampled.TimeStampedCounterValue objects count is increasing as the test run.

After analyzing the heap dumps, we found that the ServerMessageTransportImpl is leaking. Further analysis revealed that on every client disconnect, we throw an event into a JMX stage for clean up and that thread is slow in responding to cleanups. It is struck in JMX code trying to connect to some server. The theory is that if that thread takes more time to clean up than the time between client disconnect and new client connects, then we will end up with an OOME.

Hi. 

Can someone please give me an update on how the investigation into this problem is progressing? Has a fix been identified, and if so, when is it likely to be available?

Thanks.

James.

I have attached a new zip file containing the logs from some testing we have been performing against the 2.5.1 release.

I have some concern that the out of memory error has not been fully resolved.

Running the same test code as before, after a period of time the Terracotta Server seems to refuse client connections.

I am going to run the tests again, but wanted to let you know that we are still having problems.

Did you have any problems when running our sample code against the 2.5.1 release?
