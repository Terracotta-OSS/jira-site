## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Version : ehcache-1.4.1

I was wondering why my caches we not flushed to disk and found out that my Cache Elements contained Collections with null values which are not considered as Serializable by EHCache ...

In Element.java:498 :
    public final boolean isSerializable() {
        return key instanceof Serializable && value instanceof Serializable;
    }

The problem is that null instanceof Serializable returns false although null can be serialized.

I changed that to :

    public final boolean isSerializable() {
        return key instanceof Serializable && ((value == null) || (value instanceof Serializable));
    }

And it works fine now.
