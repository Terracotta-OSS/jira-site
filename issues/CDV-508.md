## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The internal implementation of java.util.EnumSet has two flavors (RegularEnumSet and JumboEnumSet). The regular version is used for enum types with 64 or fewer values, the jumbo version is all other enums.

As proved by the EnumTest system test, the "regular" case works. By try creating a clustered EnumSet with an enum with 64+ values and you'll get a non-portable exception for java.util.JumboEnumSet.

I just noticed it is a bug looking at the code -- I can't imagine many people will ever hit this
