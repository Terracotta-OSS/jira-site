## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From looking at code, looks like the ExecutorService in KeySnapshotter is not properly shutdown when cacheManager is shutdown.

This can be problematic:
- cause cacheManager leak (from executor thread -> task -> tcStore -> cache -> cacheManager)
- tasks can still execute even after cache.dispose

BootstrapCacheTest has commented out code for this. Need to fix in toolkit2 (or trunk, if toolkit2 is merged earlier)

There are 2 different CacheManagers there.
The first is on the on from the test, the other one is the one that's gone...

Even after clearing the Listener identified by the above screenshot, the problem still exists. ClientObjectManagerImpl holds the reference of TCObjectServerMapImpl

Can you pull in someone who's done some of that rework for TK2.0 ?

For rejoin enabled toolkit this test case is working now.
Some problem exists with rejoin disabled toolkits for which a separate JIRA (DEV-9798) is present
