## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

You could add 

-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true

to the startup options of Sessions Configurator. That way, it'd use the native menu bar (on top of screen instead of on the window frame) when run on OS X, making it fit in with the rest of the OS GUI. That system property does nothing on other OSes, so it's safe to just add it, you needn't specifically test for OS.
