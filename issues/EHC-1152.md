## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Check http://central.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache-root/2.10.5/ehcache-root-2.10.5.pom - it has a parent dependency to net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-parent:2.21 which isn't available on central (http://central.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache-parent/)

The missing artifact should be deployed ASAP as it isn't possible for any project released on central to depend upon ehcache 2.10.5, and our deployment procedure should be fixed accordingly.

[~lorban] can you please verify it's fixed thanks ?
ehcache parent 2.21 was published in January to ... our internal Nexus.
[~akom] just published it to Maven Central
