## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Similar to existing Terracotta Hibernate cache provider, add ability to generate a new ehcache.xml that matches the current dynamic config (which presumably differs from the original config).  This capability needs to be exposed up through the Ehcache MBeans.
