We should honor web.xml cookie settings, ie:

    <cookie-config>
      <name>SESSIONID</name>
      <max-age>600</max-age>
    </cookie-config>

note: 
1. websphere-7.0.0, weblogic-10.3.1, jboss-6.0.0 don't support Servlet 3.0
2. only tomcat-7.0.x and above supports Servlet 3.0

Not that you need to add more app server support but things like newer welogic, jetty 8, etc also support servlet 3.0. Because of that I think the test for this stuff should only disable itself for things that known NOT to work (not the other way around). That way when we bring a new app server into the monkeys this test will run against it without any updates.

fixed for Tomcat 7.0.x. It's currently the only appserver that we test again, that supports Servlet 3.0
