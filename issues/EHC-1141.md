More from CA Technologies. We noticed this terracotta posting from many years ago.

We are running version 2.5.2. We are wondering if the GC or jdk observations made on this posting pertain to this much later version.

Also, please note that the problem described in our previous posting occurred on WAS 8.5.5.8. We are also consulting with IBM -- just putting this out there in case anyone has had problems with ehCache 2.5.+ on WAS 8.5.5.

-The whole point of the blocking cache is that it will \1block\1 on a {{get}} until there is something to return.-
-So you are expected to be putting an entry at some point from another thread.- Sorry, that was written to fast and is wrong.

The first thread for which {{get}} returns {{null}} will keep a lock, blocking all subsequent {{get}} on the same key from other threads.
The thread that saw the {{null}} return \1must\1 {{put}} a value in order to unblock all blocked {{get}}.

Note that other threads will also be blocked from doing a {{put}}.

Why are you using a {{BlockingCache}}?
