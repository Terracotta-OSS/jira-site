## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Ehcache 2.0.1 kit contains slf4j 1.5.8 but newest is 1.5.11.  Also, it contains only the jdk14 impl jar but not other very popular impl jars (log4j, commons logging).  In my case, I used the 1.5.8 api jar but then needed the log4j impl.  I downloaded the latest slf4j (not really paying much attention) and grabbed the log4j impl, which led me to this error:

SLF4J: The requested version 1.5.11 by your slf4j binding is not compatible with [1.5.5, 1.5.6, 1.5.7, 1.5.8]
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#version\_mismatch for further details.

so I then had to dig through some old slf4j releases to find the proper jar.  (I'm not using Maven.)

This was all fixable in several ways and due to my experience I had no trouble doing so but is just another road bump for some devs trying to use ehcache.
