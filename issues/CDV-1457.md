## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The clustered write behind is scoped at cache manager level, which is a bug. I forgot to append the cache's name to the root name for registration of the clustered async coordinator.

This affects people using different caches with write behind in the same cache manager, the clustered write behind will use the config settings of the first cache that is registered and the elements of the caches will all be processed by the same write behind queue.

I'll have to look at that code but maybe we should only have one map root indexed by cache manager name and keep all the sub-objects (store-map, serializers, write behind, etc) all be in the map by cache manager name. Maybe this would avoided the scope problem in the first place. Might make the code less repetitive too :-)

We definitely need to rework TerracottaClusteredInstanceFactory for the SPI/API stuff

There's no real workaround, people that want to isolate cache writers amongst caches will have to put the caches in different cache managers.
