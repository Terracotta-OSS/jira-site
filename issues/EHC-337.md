## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The ehcache library, under many 1.4 and 1.5 VMs requires the 
commons-collections.jar library, despite the docs saying that it 
doesn't.  It shouldn't... why have extra unused dependencies?

This patch fixes that issue.

dependency problems please report them.
