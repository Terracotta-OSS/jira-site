## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If you drop a TIM in terracotta-2.5.2/modules, it won't be able to load (which it should since we stated to support flat structure)

The work around is to create a maven like structure and drop the TIM in there,

Nightly from trunk however supports the flat structure.

I believe the port of DEV-1306 from trunk to 2.5 will resolve this issue.

Is this a regression?  If so, seems like a serious one as it could easily break customers.

It's not a regression, 2.5.1 has this bug also.

It may actually load, we think. it warns that it has not loaded.
