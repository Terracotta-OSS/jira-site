Start the monitor server without license key, which will use the temporary license (expires after 12 or 24 hours ..not sure)
check the monitor server console after 12 or 24 hours

Can't reproduce with 1.0.0-beta. Note that the expired warning will print \1every time\1 users or the monitor server queries the probe. So you'll see each warning message for each request. You might see multiple warnings if the monitor server queries multiple times in a row
