## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

cannot interrupt LinkedBlockingQueue when TC server is down.

1. Run attached reproduce case
2. Kill TC server within 5 seconds ... test fails

This was originally characterized as a bug in tim-jmx events (FORGE-402), but this new reproduce case indicates the problem is not related to tim-jmx.
