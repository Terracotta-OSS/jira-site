## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The existing config bundle uses autolocks in many of the methods, but there is no synchronization in the RAMDirectory to autolock.  I tried using auto-synchronization, but that breaks when using RAMInputStream and RAMOutputStream (because they aren't usually shared, plus auto-synchronizing doesn't actually synchronize on the right stuff).

At the moment, the only way to use Lucene is to use custom locking or named locks, but the config module doesn't really work. 

While we're at it, we might look at supporting Lucene 2.2.0 as well as Lucene 2.0.0 (as of this writing, Liferay uses Lucene 2.0.0, so we want to keep support for that).

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

this should be fixed now to the best of my knowledge -- the two tests pass w/o using an external locking at least.

Lucene 2.2.0 looks a good deal different than 2.0.0. I'm going to enter another item for supporting that.
