## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We need the ability to utilize ehcache over RMI over SSL. This patch allows ehcache to use a globally set custom RMISocketFactory implementation that in our case uses SSL. Unless a custom RMISocketFactory is set ehcache will continue to use the default RMISocketFactory.

There was a patch attached to the original sourceforge issue that should be attached here as well.   The tracker is now private but I believe the link is:
