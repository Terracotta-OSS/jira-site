## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

UnlockedSharedObjectException (and I think all similar exceptions) say:

For more information on this issue, please visit our Troubleshooting Guide at:
 http://terracotta.org/kit/troubleshooting

However this url no longer works.  I suspect it should instead reference:
  http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/wiki/Troubleshooting+Guide

But PM should verify that before we fix it.

I did a search and I found the following places that need to be updated:
- com.tc.text.ConsoleNonPortableReasonFormatter
- com.tc.object.tx.ClientTransactionManagerImpl  (seems like this should really be using the former if possible?)
- com.tc.text.NonPortableReasonFormatterTest
