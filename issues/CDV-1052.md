## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There are two places in ArrayManager (register() and getObject()) where the array object hash code maps into an array of maps, but this could does not take into consideration negative hash code values for arrays.  

Also, I think I'd argue that the object->hash bucket logic should be moved into a common helper method.

Found with FindBugs...
