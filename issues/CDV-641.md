## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a project using the ehcache-1.3 TIM.  I'm getting a warning on launch that net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager is not instrumented.  This instrumentation is supplied by the TIM.

</div>

Same project as CDV-640.  Maybe this is a downstream problem of not finding the TIM in CDV-640?
