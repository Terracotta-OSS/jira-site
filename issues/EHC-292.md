## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

A cache configured for overflowToDisk invokes MemoryStore.flush() from Cache.dispose() when CacheManager.shutdown() is invoked. This causes all in-memory entries to be flushed to disk. However when DiskStore is disposed of unless this store is marked as persistent the data files are deleted. This causes unnecessary delay to the shutdown process. MemoryStore.dispose() needs to bypass the call to flush() unless the cache.isDiskPersistent().
