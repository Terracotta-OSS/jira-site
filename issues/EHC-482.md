## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I would group the stats as follows and in this order by default.  I
think the \*'ed are the most important and the +'ed are my second
wave.  Mike, any thoughts on which to include by default?  Would it be
simpler to just have a "basic" and "extended" sets instead of
requiring you to check every box?

Size:
- Total count \*
- Mem count +
- Disk count +

Cache efficiency:
- MISSING: Hit ratio \*
- Hit rate +
- Disk hit rate
- Mem hit rate
- Miss rate +

Cache modifications:
- Put rate \*
- Remove rate +
- Update rate

Eviction rates:
- Eviction rate \*
- Expiration rate +
