## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Bring up the Config Editor, navigate to Clients tab and add a module repository.
Now select that repo and click Remove.

Result: SWTException control has been disposed.

The table needs to get the focus before the remove happens so the in-cell editor is removed first.

The work-around is to manually remove the repo from the config using the XML page.


</div>
