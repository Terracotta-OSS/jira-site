## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In particular, in might be useful to enable logging for  when sessions become invalidated (see http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/158.page). The log message would contain the session ID and probably a stack trace. 

I'm sure there are some other aspects of session where debug logging could be added. 

This type of logging would most certainly be disabled by default

Could also use some debug logging around what session IDs are coming in and the result of the session lookup is  (and the source of the id, cookie or URL)
