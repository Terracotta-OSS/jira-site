<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Any plans regarding this? We use a huge number of DiskStore-backed caches and EhCache spawns a thread per cache that does basically nothing most of the time. This consumes resources (OS threads and stack memory for each thread, which defaults to 1 MB in 64 bit JVMs, though can be tuned with Xss JVM parameter).
