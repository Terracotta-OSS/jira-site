## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If you have host="%i" in tc-config.xml 

in 2.5.0, the jmx server binds to:
2008-01-13 14:49:18,764 INFO - JMX Server started. Available at URL[service:jmx:jmxmp://localhost:9520]

in 2.5.1 nighlty, it binds to:
2008-01-13 14:48:29,760 INFO - JMX Server started. Available at URL[service:jmx:jmxmp://192.168.1.102:9520]

"192.168.1.102" is router assigned IP.

As a result, Admin console won't be able to connect to "localhost" in the case of 2.5.1 nightly since "localhost" resolves to "127.0.0.1".
Major problem for users who're trying the demos. Connecting to "localhost" as the default won't work.
