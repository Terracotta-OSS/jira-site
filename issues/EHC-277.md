There is a similar feature request related to the functionality in 1.2 beta4 
whereby listeners do not get notified when a remote put or remove is 
received. This functionality has been changed so that they do get notified.

Two new methods in Cache have been added:
- put(Element element, boolean doNotNotifyCacheReplicators)
- remove(Serializable key, boolean doNotNotifyCacheReplicators) 

These methods address your feature request but also provide the mechanism 
to provide correct behaviour for notifications received from remote cache 
peers.

This feature is in trunk and will be in ehcache-1.2 beta5
