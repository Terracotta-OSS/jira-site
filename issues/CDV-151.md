## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

class Pojo \{
Integer i;
\}


When this object gets shared for the first time, if "i" contains some valid Integer, then the server generates a class that can hold an "int" for i.

But later if ever the reference is set to null, then that change cannot be applied in the server since it generated the type as "int"

This is true for other primitive types too.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I think we should be able to fix it by changing TCFieldFactory method from 

public static boolean isReferenceClass(Class type) \{
    return !literalValues.isLiteral(type.getName());
\}

to something like this

public static boolean isReferenceClass(Class type) \{
    return !literalValues.isJAVALiteral(type.getName());
\}

thought it might increase the server memory foot print for primitive values (only the java.lan.\* ones though)
