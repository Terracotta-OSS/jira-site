## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When running EHCache in distributed mode the method RMICacheManagerPeerListener.calculateHostAddress() returns IP address 6 on Linux with JDK 1.5.0\_10 - which won't work as the method Naming.rebind called in RMICacheManagerPeerListener.bind() is expecting an IPv4 address

InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostAddress()

but getLocalHost() returns (as per the JavaDocs) the loopback NIC. This causes the cache to broadcast itself as listening to (in my case) 127.0.1.1:XXX which is inaccessible from other hosts. I've created a patch that returns the first IPv4 for NIC 0 ("eth0" in Linux, "en0" in OSX). 

The attached file outlines the new code for RMICacheManagerPeerListener.calculateHostAddress(). Feel free to use it as you like. You can reach me at fredrikborgh at yahoo . com if you have any questions.
