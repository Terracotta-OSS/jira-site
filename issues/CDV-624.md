## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

All TIMs should be named using dashes instead of underscores, for parity with Maven conventions.  There is currently a mixture of dashes and underscores.

Once renamed, Resolver and ModulesLoader must also be updated to make dashes and underscore distinct, so that
foo\1bar and foo-bar are two different names, so that if someone specifies foo\1bar in the manifest, we expect a foo\1bar filename somewhere.

This is not resolved yet. I have the (uncommitted) changes in trunk (and related changes to tc-maven-plugin's tc-2.5 branch) 

This is also related to DEV-1306, so these changes will also be ported into DSO 2.5 branch - please note/comment if this is not the case before DEV-1306 is tackled.
