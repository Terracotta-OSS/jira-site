## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'd like to be able to insert system properties into the ehcache.xml file.

Many of the .xml configuration files used in JBoss allow you to insert a system property into the file using a $\{property\} notation.  This makes it easier to have a single version of a file deployed to multiple environments, with system properties used to capture environment specific details.

As a specific example with ehcache: when configuring distributed caching, a multicast group address needs to be specified for the cacheManagerProviderFactory.  This IP address will be different between our Production, Staging, Test, and Development environments, but the rest of the ehcache.xml file is identical across all of these environments.  In a machine specific launch script, I'd like to define a system property "multicastAddress=230.0.0.12", and then insert that into the ehcache.xml config file as:
<cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory 
class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, 
multicastGroupAddress=$\{multicastAddress\}, 
multicastGroupPort=4446, timeToLive=1"/>

Is it really fixed? I see no such functionality in ehcache.

I didn't make the fix and I haven't personally verified anything but the translateSystemProperties() method in ./src/main/java/net/sf/ehcache/config/ConfigurationFactory.java seems to be in direct response to this item
