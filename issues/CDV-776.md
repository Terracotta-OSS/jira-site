## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In looking at this forum issue:
http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/1126.page

it hit me that having a debug instrumentation in the config that would dump the named classloader loading each (instrumented?) class would be helpful in tracking down many classloader problems.

So, I'd propose either one or two new flags for the config that would dump the named classloader being used to load a class either always or only on instrumented classes.  I'm not sure if always would give you too much output to be worth while.  

Another alternative might be to let users see the defining loader description in the admin console, maybe on demand in some way.

If at all possible to do this in the near term or sometime in 2.6 branch we could merge to trunk.
Taylor also thinks this would be very valuable
