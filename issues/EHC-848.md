## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When using a custom search attribute extractor, ala: 
\{quote\}
<searchAttribute name="foo" class="com.blah.Foo"/>
\{quote\}

You have no way to provide any state to the constructed instance (the nullary constructor must exist and is always used)

This item is to provide some means for passing something to the constuctor. That something might be a Properties object, or maybe just a single string that is up to application developer to delimit/parse as they see fit.

This approach is an alternative to providing a full blown factory pattern here
