## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It would be so great if the Statistics class hung onto the string name of the cache across serialization.

This would require just adding another private String field to Statistics, setting the field in the constructor and then making getAssociatedCacheName() return the value if cache is null. 

Adding this simple thing would make this class infinitely more useful.
