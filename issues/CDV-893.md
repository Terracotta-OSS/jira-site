## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Doing thread.interrupt() on a thread trying to acquire a shared lock with lockInterruptibly() doesn't release the blocked thread as it happens in a non-clustered environment. This happens both for ReentrantLock and ReentrantReadWriteLock.

The workaround consists in using a custom made interruptible lock based on two reentrant locks and a condition variable (await-ing on a condition is interrupted on thread.interrupt()).

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The fix for ReentrantLock is now in place (CDV-892).  A fix for RRWL is coded (using the same solution as is now used for ReentrantLock).  Some slightly more rigorous tests are required before the RRWL fix is checked-in however.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

ReentrantLock fix now extended to cover RRWL.  Accompanying test ensures the semantics of RRWL still hold true.  The ReentrantLock tests will ensure the robustness of the common code.
