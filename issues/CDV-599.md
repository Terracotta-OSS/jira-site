## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Due to some changes related to the bootstrapping of the DSO client (CDV-424, DEV-959), the dso client is started before the debugger subsystem is started in the VM. This means you can't attach the debugger until things like config are resolved and the connection to the L2 is made. 

This issue is mostly an annoyance to terracotta developers and module writers who might want to use the debugger at this stage of the VM startup.
