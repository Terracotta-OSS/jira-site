## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment lock recalls that happen due to an explicit call to ManagerUtil.evictLock do not appear in the statistics - this should probably be fixed.  Currently the only use of lock eviction is the CSM.  You can kind of work round this in CSM by checking for flushing of the map entries (every flush will have an associated lock recall - depending on the locking scheme) - but that is far from ideal.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The concept of an evicted lock no longer exists.  Locks are now just unpinned and the lock is gc'ed in the same way as a lock that was never pinned.
