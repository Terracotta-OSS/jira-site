This is a problem with Spring enabled configuration.  Find attached the code to reproduce it.

It is a bug with RenetrantReadWriteLock instrumentation. dsoLock is defined as transient inside ReentrantReadWriteLockTC.WriteLock and ReentrantReadWriteLockTC.ReadLock, but while instrumenting honorTransient is not set true. So in DSO configuration, dsoLock  object is still shared by terracotta. 

Somehow with Spring configuration, transient is honored and dsoLock object is not shared with terracotta and while dehyderating the ReentrantReadWriteLock inside another JVM, it fails with nullpointer exception as dsoLock is null.

ideally dsoLock object should not be transient. I tested by removing transient keyword for dsoLock and it works fine. Attached is the modified ReentrantReadWriteLockTC code that makes it work

I think I might remember spring having a default of honor transient true while the rest of dso had it false. I wonder if that is the cause of this issue?

Yeah, that should be the issue. But defining dsoLock as transient is not required in first place.

There is a class hierarchy walker that is responsible for automatically adding includes for classes referenced by the clustered Spring beans and it sets honor transient flag on those classes using DSOClientConfigHelper.addIncludeAndLockIfRequired(..) call

Though walker should be ignoring any classes that are included using <instrumented-classes> or registered y any other means, which doesn't seem happening in your test project. My guess is that DSOClientConfigHelper.addIncludeAndLockIfRequired(..) is not respecting includes created trough getOrCreateSpec(..) call.

BTW, Nitin, you mentioned that issue is fixed in the nightly build. What was actually changed?

I intended to say that it will be fixed soon and made available in nightly build. Nothing is fixed yet. May be I should not have made this statement without confirmation from Engineering.

dsoLock is transient so that a serialized TC version of ReentrantReadWriteLock could be de-serialized into a non-TC environment.

This issue is fixed by not adding to the include pattern if the class already has a spec for it in the StandardDsoClientConfig.
