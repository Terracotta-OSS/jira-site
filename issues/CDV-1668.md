## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At some point Oracle changed the proxy generation code in JDK 1.6 and call paths shifted slightly.  This prevented us from trimming DSO interfaces out of the proxy interfaces arguments, and caused ProxyTest to fail.  A simple instrumentation fix is required to patch the new call path.
