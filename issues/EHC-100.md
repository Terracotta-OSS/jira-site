## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The DiskStore is intended to have asynchronous
behaviour. However, under contention it degrades to
nearly synchronous behaviour.

There are multiple reasons for this:

1) The spool thread (and the expiry thread) both run at
the normal priority level.
2) The spool thread locks the entire DiskStore.
3) The spool thread is notified immediately upon an
entry being placed in the spool. This means that it is
instantly contending for the lock, and has a good
chance of getting in before anything else.
4) While the spool thread is de-spooling, no other
entries can be added to the DiskStore.

A test can be easily created Create a Cache with a
small MemoryStore, and put in significantly more
elements (e.g. a cache size of 10, and 10000 elements)
in a loop. The degraded performance should be obvious.

The easiest fix is to lower the priority of the spool
and expiry thread.

A better fix is to not have the spool or expiry thread
lock the spool while interacting with the disk.
Ideally, clients should be able to:
1) Add new entries to the store
2) Retrieve entries that happen to be in the disk spool
still
3) Query for the presence of an entry in the store

all while the spooling is occuring. This could be done
by using locks on the individual DiskElement and the
backing file, instead of just the DiskStore.

If I get a chance, I'll see if I can get a patch made.
