## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

FindBugs noticed that batchData field in this message is dehydrateValues and hydrateValue do not synchronize access to batchData while some of the other methods do.  This may actually be ok in our usage patterns but someone should verify.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Removed unnecessary synchronization that tips off find bug. Since we move messages from one thread to another thru seda queue, that will give us the synchronization point.
