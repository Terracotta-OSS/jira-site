## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The produced log file, due to a misconfigured application, needed more than 8GB after 2 hours (and would probably be even bigger). I think the reason is a class that is not instrumented within a object graph, which causes the whole object graph to be logged. However, this object graph did contain some \*big\* byte arrays that made the log file explode:

I doubt, that this behavior (which filled my disk and rendered my system useless) is desired. well, you could argue, that log files should be on a separate partition and I would totally agree. However, most of the information in the log is useless and extremely verbose (> 150 characters to display each byte in a byte array), so it would probably make sense to improve logging.

JIRA removed all the white spaces from every log-line. see http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/1055.page

yeah, we're probably a bit verbose in this logging. I think maybe not printing every element of primitive arrays and only on a single log line could go a long way here. It's a trade off of course, but I think we've erred providing too much detail here.

You can disable it if you'd like (it is on by default). More info here:
http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/docs1/Configuration+Guide+and+Reference#ConfigurationGuideandReference-tc%3Atcconfig%2Fclients%2Fdso%2Fdebugging%2Fruntimelogg...

Your application should have been receiving TCNonPortableObjectErrors at this time too
