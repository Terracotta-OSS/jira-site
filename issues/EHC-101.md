## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I am using ehcache 0.9 with hibernate 3.0.
For my suite of applications, I am using hibernate (and
therefore ehcache) as a configurable service that is
deployed independent of the application.  The cache is
configured by the application through the file
ehcache.xml, which on the application's classpath.  

The method
net.sf.ehcache.config.Configurator.configure( Object)
loads ehcache.xml using the class loader from the
Configurator class.  Since ehcache is loaded by a class
loader "downstream" of my application, it does not find
this file.

In Hibernate, they use the thread's classloader for
configuration loading.  I wonder if the same approach
would be appropriate here?
For example, to work around the problem, in the
configure method, I changed:
        URL url =
getClass().getResource(DEFAULT\_CLASSPATH\_CONFIGURATION\_FILE);

to
        ClassLoader classLoader =
Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
        URL url =
classLoader.getResource(DEFAULT\_CLASSPATH\_CONFIGURATION\_FILE);

(An alternative solution would be for hibernate's
EHCaceProvider to instantiate a URL for ehcache.xml and
this pass this to  the configure(Object, URL) method,
so I will also post this issue to Hibernate.)

Thanks.
