This was the Issue Tracker link on the site, not the changelog which was already fixed. 

Fixed.

This is still not fixed.  All the links in your change logs report are still pointing to invalid URLs.

To fix, you need to modify your ehcache-core-trunk/pom.xml with the following (both the plugin version and the additional configuration)....

<!--Manual Changelist -->
			<plugin>

Obviously that "&lt;"  in the previous comment needs to be a less than sign ( < )

Jon

This change does not work. 

It goes to https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/ViewIssue.jspa?key=EHC-357

It needs to go to https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/EHC-357

It seems others are having the same problem. 

http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MCHANGES-166

Not sure when this will be fixed in Maven.

I made this change locally on my machine and generated the site, and it fixed the issue.

To get it to work it required updating the changes plugin version to 2.3 AND adding that configuration section.

I'm fairly certain there was nothing else I changed to get it to work.
