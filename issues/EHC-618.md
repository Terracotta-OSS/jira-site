## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Check out https://svn.terracotta.org/repo/ehcache/branches/ehcache-core-2.0.0-beta/core

Run:  mvn deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DskipTests=true -Dcheckstyle.skip=true


Error:

[INFO] Error deploying artifact: Failed to transfer file: http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-releases/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache-core/2.0.0-beta/ehcache-core-2.0.0-beta.jar. Return code is: 400

Seems Sonatype release repo doesn't allow us to upload 2.0.0-beta for some reason.

Greg sent email on 1/20 about a new staging repo on Sonatype.  I don't know if this is what is causing the issue.

From Greg:

The deploy issue is that the new sonatype release procedure must be to staging. I have changed the URL and deployed. I have committed the new URL to trunk.

I am sorting out permissions with sonatype to actually promote the staged artifact from staging to release. ccing Hung only on this so as not to spam everyone.

This is now fixed.

There is an extra step after pushing to stage. You need to login and "close" the temporary staging repository.
