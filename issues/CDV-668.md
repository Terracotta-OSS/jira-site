## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Recreate:

1. Lock Profiler
2. Set trace depth to 0
3. turn on lock profiler
4. make changes (use shared editor or something)
5. refresh

Expected: lock stats in the client tab
Actual: 0 values

Seems to be a regression from 2.5

(note that trace depth of 1 works)
