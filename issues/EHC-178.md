## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

While running the M2 build I find that the three antrun plugins don't work. I didn't need the two doc ones, so I commented them out, but the rmic one seemed more important.

Following the workaround suggested at http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MANTRUN-23 - I added a xml block and stopped getting the error:

<dependencies>
 <dependency>
  <groupId>sun</groupId>
  <artifactId>tools</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
  <scope>system</scope>
  <systemPath>$\{java.home\}/../lib/tools.jar</systemPath>
 </dependency>
</dependencies>

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
