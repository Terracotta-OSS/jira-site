## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Steps:

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample demo server from /samples/start-demo-server.bat
3. Launch the rife demo by execute start-load-balancer.bat from /sample/rife/continuations 
4. start the tomcat1 from /sample/rife/continuations/start-tomcat1.bat

Actual: Unable to run rife demos
Expected: rife demo to be moved to Forge (according to DEV1710)

6.0 version 2.7.0.SNAPSHOT (group-id: org.terracotta.modules)

   Attempted to resolve the TIM using the following descriptors:

      groupId: org.terracotta.modules
      name   : clustered-rife-1.6.0
      Version: 2.7.0.SNAPSHOT

   Expected the TIM's filename to be:

      clustered-rife-1.6.0-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

   Expected these attributes to be in the manifest:

      Bundle-SymbolicName: org.terracotta.modules.clustered-rife-1.6.0
      Bundle-Version     : 2.7.0.SNAPSHOT

   Searched using the following repositories:

      + C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-2.7.0-stable0\modules

   Tried to resolve the jar file using the following paths:

      + C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-2.7.0-stable0\modules\org\terraco
tta\modules\clustered-rife-1.6.0\2.7.0-SNAPSHOT\clustered-rife-1.6.0-2.7.0-SNAPS
HOT.jar
      + C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-2.7.0-stable0\modules\clustered-r
ife-1.6.0-2.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

   If the jar file exists and is in one of the paths listed above, make sure tha
t the Bundle-SymbolicName and
   Bundle-Version attribute in its manifest matches the ones that the resolver e
xpects.

   If you do not have this particular TIM or any of its dependencies installed,
try using the tim-get tool's
   'install' command:

      C:\> tim-get.bat install clustered-rife-1.6.0 2.7.0.SNAPSHOT org.terracott
a.modules

   You can also use the tool's 'list' command to see if it's actually available:


      C:\> tim-get.bat list clustered-rife-1.6.0   # list anything that has 'clu
stered-rife-1.6.0' in it's name
      C:\> tim-get.bat list                        # or, list everything that is
 available

   For more information on how to use the tim-get tool, invoke:

      C:\> tim-get.bat help

We should move the rife demo to Forge.

The workaround is to update ~/samples/rife/continuations/]tc-config.xml replace "clustered-rife-1.6.0" with " tim-rife-1.1.0"
The tim-get tool will then get and install the correct

Kalai
can you confirm that the workaround I have suggested works?

Once this is confirmed I will update the config file in svn, so that this doesn't happen again.

Verified that the change to use tim-rife works in 2.7.0 kit.
By following steps
Steps:

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample demo server from /samples/start-demo-server.bat
3. Launch the rife demo by execute start-load-balancer.bat from /sample/rife/continuations
4. start the tomcat1 from /sample/rife/continuations/start-tomcat1.bat 

Tomcat started with no errors.

Tested with  Terracotta 2.7.1-nightly, as of 20081028-161009 (Revision 10697 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), 
Still unable to run rife demos due to different version of tim-rife available on the forge

Steps:
1. Install the kit
2. Navigate to /bin and execute tim-get.bat list
3. tim-rife-1.6.0 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT is available for TC 2.7.1-SNAPSHOT
4. execute tim-get.bat install tim-rife-1.6.0
5. Launch the rife demo by execute start-load-balancer.bat from /sample/rife/continuations
6. start the tomcat1 from /sample/rife/continuations/start-tomcat1.bat 
7. In the tc-config.xml, expected tim-rife version is 1.1.1-snapshot
<modules>
      <module name="tim-rife" version="1.1.1-SNAPSHOT"/>
    </modules>

Actual: tim-rife version mentioned in the kit is not available on the forge.

Juris can you take a look at this and see how we can fix it "hacky" for 2.7.1? Then move to the forge for 2.7.x?

Fixed in r10730 (2.7 branch), r10731 (trunk)

We now inject tim-rife info into selected demos - just like we do with tim-apache-struts.
It's not a "hacky" fix, so we could now let this demo (or similar demos that might use a TIM) remain in the kit if we want to.

---

A related issue however is that, for TIMs that are compatible for any TC version, the version that comes from trunk will always take precedence over any other version when dealing with SNAPSHOTs. 

So, in this case, when we're building nightlies for TC kits, the injected demos (which would be snapshots) will be the ones that are coming from the Forge trunk --- so you might see that a TC kit nightly will use tim-rife-1.6.0 version 1.2.0-SNAPSHOT, but in the final kit, it will use tim-rife-1.6.0  version 1.1.1 --- config-wise there's no difference but it's likely not a good thing --- the fix in this case will require us to revisit our branching/versioning scheme in the Forge.

Temporarily, I've bound the trunk version of similar TIMs to a specific TC version so that their current release branches will take precedence.

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.1, as of 20081104-091101 (Revision 10759 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), the rife demo launched successfully as expected.
