## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/585.page

The code in com.terracotta.session.SessionData() that converts the idle time in seconds to milliseconds needs to widen to long before the multiply

This happens in two places in that code, look at both calls to setMaxInactiveMillis() -- maybe that method should take seconds in (and renamed the method)
