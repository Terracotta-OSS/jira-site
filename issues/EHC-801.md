## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

    \1 Keys which are already of a supported attribute type should be able to be added to queries using the attribute name "key"
    \1 same goes for values

We should add a short form config 

<searchAttribute name="key"/>
<searchAttribute name="value"/>

There will be many times when caches have keys and sometimes when they have values which are already in the supported form. 

</div>

You'd still be declaring that you want these attributes though, right? It's just the potential short cut in config that is proposed here?

In terms of the config though, the form above clashes with other idea for javabean style attributes definitions.

forget my comment above now.

"key" and "value" attributes are now always available for searchable caches. If the key and/or value object are not of the allowed type then they will be searchable.
