## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Per forum post:
http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/2185.page#12972

The pendingLockRequests and waitLocksByRequesterID maps are initialized as empty maps and rely on UnsupportedOperationException exceptions to instantiate real maps. This seems indeed needlessly expensive and can be done through pre-conditions.

This change is what caused this. I think this could be done through some flags instead and a bit more code instead of throwing a lot of needless exceptions.

If we get time can we clean this up?

The change that caused it was 12167 - I made the change to reduce memory usage of ClientLock instances for simple lock usage.  I have a fix for this on my local machine (using a ref check against a statically held empty map like Geert and Tim suggested via email).  Will checkin after we reopen things after JavaOne code freeze.

Switch to a singleton map/set and use a reference check for lazy instantiation.
