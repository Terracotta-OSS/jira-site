CDV-170, CDV-173, and CDV-230 are all related in a sense both deal with different scenario of extending from logical collections. I think at one point we were saying we want to deal with all these different cases in a generic way by providing a hybrid physical-logical sharing. We have some classes that we are shared in a hybrid physical-logical way like TreeHashMap, ConcurrentHashMap. But those are deal with on a case by case basis.

I think we were saying we want to provide a generic way of supporting a hybrid physical-logical sharing. That should fix most (if not all)  logical subclasses scenarios.
