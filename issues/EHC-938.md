I don't think you're soliciting design for that feature at the moment, but
since it came up I think it would probably be a good idea to have the
default/automatic annotation name pattern contain both something like
"ehcache" and "IgnoreSizeOf". Of course google is telling me that
IgnoreSizeOf look likes a term specific to ehcache at the moment

I was indeed thinking of honouring any @IgnoreSizeOf annotation,
regardless of its package.
Now we could have the \1.ehcache.IgnoreSizeOf or something. That very one
would actually not include ours
(net.sf.ehcache.pool.sizeof.annotations.IgnoreSizeOf)... Not really a big
deal.
One other open question is whether we'd want to support "extensions" to
the annotation in both variances (currently only inherited defaulting to
false, but who knows what the future might bring). I'd, right now, argue
for no... Thoughts ?

I don't feel super strongly on this point, but I was thinking that the pattern would be more like {noformat}"\1ehcache\1IgnoreSizeOf\1"{noformat} or something. Just to avoid any possible unintended cross talk with an IgnoreSizeOf that was not for ehcache purposes.
