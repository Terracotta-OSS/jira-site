## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a transactional cache (local, xa or xa\1strict) is configured with a short TTI or TTL there's a high probability to run into a deadlock.

Attached example app reproduces the problem.

The deadlock seems to be caused by a 'lock leak' which can happen when an inline eviction fails b/c of a transaction timeout.

Surrounding the eviction code with a try / finally block releasing the lock in the finally seems to solve the issue.
