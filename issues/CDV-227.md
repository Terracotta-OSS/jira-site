## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently customers have to implement "Heap Rollback" functionality in their applications, in case of requirements that require flushes to Terracotta server be "all-or-nothing".

Given several/frequent requests , this is a place holder for a potential Terracotta feature, where in case of an exception within the scope of a monitor, changes are not flushed to the Terracotta server but instead mutated managed objects are faulted in from the Terracotta server - (perhaps the user gets to specify this behavior per lock in the lock-section of the config).
