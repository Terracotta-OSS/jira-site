## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think this might be a duplicate of another bug I filed, but it's still not fixed.

JETTY\1HOME is set automatically so it seems something doesn't work right on OSX. It works fine on Windows and Linux.

Could you add "set -x" at the beginning of startNode.sh and paste the output here?

See CDV-1156 for the original which was marked not reproducible.  I\'m guess here that w tried to reproduce it on Linux. Mac is not a "supported" platform.

Ah.  It looks like I have JETTY\1HOME automatically set by my startup scripts to a directory that doesn't exist.  Unsetting JETTY\1HOME solves the problem.  But, it's still a potential gotcha that we ought to document.
