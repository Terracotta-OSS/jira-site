## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think it is possible for two nodes to "evict" the same element right now (if the element is local on more than one node). Only one them will actually remove something from the underlying store, but the evict() method can get called more than once for the same element. The eviction events on session invalidation cannot be called more than once per spec. We just need to be careful to trigger the events in the right place (ie. only on the node that actually removes something).
