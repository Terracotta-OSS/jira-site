## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

For maps that have striped locking (eg.j.u.c.ConcurrentHashMap or our ConcurrentDistributedMap) we have differing behavior for identity keys (ie. those that don't override hashCode() and rely strictly on object identity). 

At the moment those types of keys will just silently not really work in CDM. In CHM we manufacture a stable cross-VM hash function for \1most\1 keys in this category, but throw an exception for non-literal, un-shared keys w/o a hashCode() override. 

This JIRA is to make a decision about the behavior and make it consistent

Nothing has been done with this. CHM and CDM differ still differ in this respect.
