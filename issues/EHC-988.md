## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since there is now only one concrete subclass of ElementEvictionData which is shared by both clustered and unclustered caches we can safely do away with the entire ElementEvictionData concept and instead inline the various timestamp data in to the Element class.

</div>

This needs to get into the FCS release since it has an API change.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

\* Removed ElementEvictionData
