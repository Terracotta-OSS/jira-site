## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently it says fails with an exception.

It should print out a help text as regular \*nix tools. There should also be a -help option that prints this text.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

-h and --help are now supported... In case not enough arguments are specified the usage banner is displayed.
all arguments have precedence over -f|--config file specified options

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Starting org.terracotta.ehcachedx.monitor.StandaloneServer without any arguments gives the following usage.
Full Usage banner:
Usage: (START|STOP) [-l <license file location>] [-i <host ip>] [-p <host port>] [-f <config file location>] [-u <user name>] [-w <password>] [-h]

-h option banner:
Command line arguments: [-l <license file location>] [-i <host ip>] [-p <host port>] [-f <config file location>] [-u <user name>] [-w <password>] [-h]

startup.sh -h doesnt displays the banner but starts the server. As per the current logic, it needs to have one argument to make it work.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Print outs the help message if we have -h/--help or missed argument for any of the parameter.

Verified in rev 5405.
