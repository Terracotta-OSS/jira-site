## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

DSO field injection currently works by instrumenting the constructors of the classes in which the injection has to happen.

However, since we don't use regular constructors during hydration, instances aren't injected into the fields of those classes.

See TCClassImpl.findConstructor line 248
and ultimately ReflectionUtil.newConstructor line  42

To be a little clearer, this means that hydrating a clustered class into a new node where that class has an injected dso instance will be missing the instance.  This is definitely a must-fix for Quintara, but not sure which release.

Talked this through with Tim and this functionality is very similar to current on-load behavior. However, users still need to be able to specify their own on-load behavior. So, I suggest adding something like on-hydrate that's only accessible internally and that would call into a generated method that's both used for on-hydrate behavior and regular construction of instances.

Seems like a user shouldn't have to do this for dso injection though.  Seems like we should just make it work automatically.  That may be what you're proposing, just want to make sure.

Yeah, automatically through an on-hydrate facility that's available for us internally.
