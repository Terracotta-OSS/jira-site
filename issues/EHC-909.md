## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since these are by their nature shared we can probably safely ignore all instances of java.lang.Class by adding it to the built-in ignore list.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I've added java.lang.Class to the built-in filter, and also removed it from the flyweight types (no need to have it in both).  I always snuck in some resource filtering changes in here to better parse the files (trimming) and also to support filtering by packages.
