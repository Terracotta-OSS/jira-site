## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently Element stores timestamps as integer seconds in order to save memory.  This causes problems for caches with a large fraction of their population all the same age (to within a second).  It make the statistical evictor appear to make mistakes, because its samples can end up all having the same timestamps, and so it cannot order them correctly, and effectively becomes a random evictor.

The test that reproduces it is:

LRUMemoryStoreTest. testProbabilisticEvictionPolicy

When the precision was changed from ms to seconds this test broke. The test was then "fixed" by adding a sleep, which is clearly contrived. I have changed the test back to its original state as I wrote it and added an @Ignore. When we fix the code lets unignore the test.

/\1\1
     \1 Test the LRU policy
     \1/
    @Ignore
    @Test
    public void testProbabilisticEvictionPolicy() throws Exception {
        createMemoryOnlyStore(MemoryStoreEvictionPolicy.LRU, 500);

        //Make sure that the store is empty to start with
        assertEquals(0, cache.getSize());

        // Populate the store till the max limit
        Element element = new Element("key1", "value1");
        for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
            cache.put(new Element("" + i, "value1"));
        }
        //Let the last used timestamps be effective for the evictor
        Thread.sleep(3010);

        //Now read to update the put count
        for (int i = 0; i < 500; i++) {
            cache.get("" + i);
        }

        //Let the last used timestamps be effective for the evictor
        //Note: This should not be necessary. It became necessary in 1.7 because the timestamp precision was changed to 1 second
//        Thread.sleep(3010);


        //Add some fresher content
        for (int i = 501; i < 750; i++) {
            cache.put(new Element("" + i, "value1"));
        }

        //The fresh ones should be kept.
        int lastPutCount = 0;
        for (int i = 501; i < 750; i++) {
            if (cache.get("" + i) != null) {
                lastPutCount++;
            }
        }
        LOG.info("Last Put count: " + lastPutCount);

        assertTrue("Ineffective eviction algorithm. Less than 230 of the last 249 put Elements remain: " + lastPutCount, lastPutCount >= 245);
    }

Suggestion for possible fix:

Can we have it so that Element as used by Terracotta CDM is different to that used by standalone. The Terracotta one is to the second as an eviction is to the L2 and therefore not harmful and the standalone is to the ms so that the evictor is more accurate.

I've moved the ElementEvictionData interface to use long milliseconds, and modified the standalone Ehcache implementation to use millisecond precision.
