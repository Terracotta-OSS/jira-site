## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This class contains shared state (the listeners Set) that can be modified by multiple threads.  Usually the listeners are installed primarily during CacheManager construction so that (common) path is ok due to safe publication.  However, the listener registry can be obtained at any time from CacheManager.getCacheManagerEventListenerRegistry() and any thread may be reading or writing the state of it.

This is probably easy to fix by simplying changing from HashSet to CopyOnWriteArraySet.  

This class also has a status field that is set to STATUS\_UNINITIALISED but never modified after that.  This is neither thread-safe (due to visibility) nor useful. :)  This should probably be changed to volatile and the status changes actually implemented OR simply removed altogether (including getStatus()).

replaced HashSet with CopyOnWriteArraySet to hold the listeners
set status field to volatile and properly set it to STATUS\_LIVE on init(), and STATUS\_SHUTDOWN on dispose()

It looks like a bug is related to this issue: During shutdown of the cacheManager or when a cachelistener is deregistered an java.langUnsupportedException is thrown:

It lools like during deregistration of the cachelisteners a java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException is thrown. This is happening because the remove() method of the COWIterator of the CopyOnWriteArrayList class is not supported!

java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException
	at java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList$COWIterator.remove(CopyOnWriteArrayList.java:1004)
	at net.sf.ehcache.event.RegisteredEventListeners.unregisterListener(RegisteredEventListeners.java:247)
