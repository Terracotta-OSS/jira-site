## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have 2 sample apps with one distributed cache.
Each cache side have a CacheEventListeners:
- a custom CacheEventListener that log each events
- a RMICacheReplicator
When app1 put an element in its cache, the app1's
listener log the event 'put'; the cache of the app2
received the element, but the app2's listener doesn't
received the event 'put'; if the app2 get the element,
it is present in it's cache.

Using ehCache 1.2 beta4 distributed cache.

The attached zip file contains:
- the 2 configuration files
- the 2 applications logs with my comments in
- the Eclipse projet of the sample app

Best regards,
