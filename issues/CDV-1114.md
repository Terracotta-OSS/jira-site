## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, CopyOnWriteArrayList and Set are non-portable.  We investigated this a bit and it would not be hard to physically instrument these classes and provide at least base level support for them.  This was requested to support tim-wicket for wicket 1.4.  It would be nice if we could include this in the next 2.7.x if possible.

Some notes here (see comments):
http://tech.puredanger.com/2009/02/02/copyonwritearraylist-concurrency-fun/

I messed with this a little and was able to work around the permanent exclude and see something basically working.  Some minimum necessities:
- make the internal transient array field clustered 
- make existing synchronized methods write locked
- make existing array() method (used for read-only methods) synchronized and read-locked
- add to boot jar

Tim also suggested that some of our internal support volatiles may make this easier to implement.

I'm taking a wild guess that you wan this to be in Quintara and next 2.7?

Yeah, it would help the wicket guys and it seems like a reasonably good thing for us to add.  But we don't have any commitment to do it.

Decided to instrument logically (although it was kind of a toss-up).  Some reasons why:
- lower memory footprint (but not a big deal)
- there are different implementations of COWAL in jdk 1.5 / 1.6 - one uses synchronized and newer uses ReentrantLock

Things to do:
- Add to BootJarTool.addInstrumentedJavaUtilCollection()
- Add spec in same places as other logical lists
- Remove from ExcludesConfiguration
- Add config somewhere
    - Make syncronized methods read/write locked
    - Make lock instance a clustered lock instance in 1.6 - need applicator and a state object
            ListManagedObjectState also needs to contain a lock object
            Extend ListManagedObjectState and contain new field for the lock
- Add tests to GenericListTest, GenericSetTest

Verified that the CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet classes are added in the boot jar with Terracotta 3.2.0-nightly, as of 20091207-081213 (Revision 14149 by cruise@su10mo4 from 3.2)
