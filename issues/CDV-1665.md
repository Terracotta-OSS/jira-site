## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hibernate 4 has change its API.
For instance has dropped org.hibernate.cache.CacheKey who is still being use in Terracotta TIM-ehcache project, as you can see here
http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/forge/projects/tim-ehcache/tags/release-1.9.8/tim-ehcache-2.x/src/main/java/org/terracotta/modules/ehcache/store/HibernateElementSerializationStrategy.java

From my stacktrace
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/hibernate/cache/CacheKey	at org.terracotta.modules.ehcache.store.HibernateElementSerializationStrategy.writeStringKey(HibernateElementSerializationStrategy.java:32)

So Terracotta uesrs can't upgrade Hibernate.
