## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Gzip filter not working good when the application is used with terracotta. The issue is specifically for contents sent via a request dispatcher, other contents are working fine. This application is working fine - I mean the gzip filter - when used without terracotta.
Please find the attached war (Source is inside the war - WEB-INF/classes) and tc-config.xml

Geert. Can you take a very quick look at this and see if you can figure it out.

I tried this with the official 3.0.0 release of Terracotta and Jetty, the example works so I suppose it's due to not using Tomcat.

Going to try with Tomcat 6.0.16 now, can you please provide the version number of Tomcat that you're using?

Confirmed, this doesn't work with Tomcat 6.0.16

It seems that the Content-Encoding header is swallowed, hence the client doesn't know that the content is gzipped and doesn't uncompress at usage.
