## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

With reference to the forum trail http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/1596.page#9736, I would like to be able to specify a client id on start up of that client.  This enables me to know if a client is a first time start or a restart and gives tme the opportunity to take appropriate action.  Currently, the Terracotta server generates the client id, which increments regardless of a new client or a restartting client.  This makes maangement of this these types of events quite difficult requiring application generated ids mapped to server generated ids.  A specific example is discussed in the thread url above.
