## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

After playing around with the Shared Editor for a while, I have the following stats for a lock:

Average Held Time: 74676
Times Requested: 674

note that 74676/674 = 111

Moving that object around results in a new stat:

Average Held Time: 144521
Times Requested: 802

note that 144521/802 = 180

It's not entirely clear that this number is truly an average, but I wouldn't expect it to increase the way it is...however I wouldn't expect the average to go from 111 to 180.

To reproduce:

Run the shared editor
Turn on lock stats (trace >= 1)
Create an object (image)
Click refresh
Move the object around
Click refresh

Why does the Average Held Time increase so much??  Maybe this is just a SharedEditor thing.

I ran this sample program, where Main.instance is a root, and it gave me unexpected results, basically every time I refreshed the statistics, for lock count x, the Average Held Time stat was 500x.  Based on the Thread.sleep(1000) I would have expected it to be 1000.

import java.io.\1;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.\1;

public class Main
{
    public static final Main instance = new Main();
    public AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);
    public String msg;

    public void run() throws Exception
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
            lockit();
        }
    }

    private synchronized void lockit() throws Exception
    {
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception
    {
       instance.run();
    }
}
