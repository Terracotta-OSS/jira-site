## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Our scripts should assume that the JDK is in the path --- we shouldn't have to rely on TC\_JAVA\_HOME
and the bootjar tool automatically uses the java that it finds to generate a bootjar.

We could also make it so that the scripts that invoke java will always check for a minimum Java version.
