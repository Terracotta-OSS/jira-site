## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

SelfPopulatingCache does not provide adequate synchronization or memory consistency in ehcache 2.3. I'm not really sure where the problem is but if you use the attached project and run "mvn test" it should fail sometimes, on my dual-core machine I see it failing about 75% of the time. If you go into the pom.xml and change the ehcache version to 2.2.0 from 2.3.1 the test always passes.

Is the same as EHC-805
Which is fixed, but hasn't been back ported to the the 2.3 line
