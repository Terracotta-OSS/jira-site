## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

To get runtime statistics for the cluster or specific node views, one still has to visit the page to start the monitoring.

It would be more convenient to simply get all this data without having to jump through the GUI hoops.  

Of course there is an argument of efficiency - but I think that is outweighed by the prevalent use case - integration.  When tuning this may be more problematic - but it is certainly easy to give the user of the tool in a tuning stage the ability to turn off certain statistics.

I would rather solve that problem more holistically than the current somewhat non-intuitive notion that graphs auto-start when visited and can never be stopped (unless the tool is restarted).
