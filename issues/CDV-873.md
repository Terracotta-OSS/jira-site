## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The CPU stat on the runtime stat pages isn't clear that it covers the host cpu, not just TC.  We can disambiguate by calling it "Host CPU" instead of just CPU

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.1-nightly, as of 20081028-161009 (Revision 10697 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), the CPU stats on the runtime statisitics is displayed as "Host CPU" as expected instead of just CPU.

Steps:
1. Install the kit
2. Launch the admin console
3. Launch the sample application launcher
4. Launch the shared editor demo
5. In the admin console, select the Server or Client|Runtime Statistics

Actual: In the right pane of runtime statistics, "Host CPU" is displayed



</div>
