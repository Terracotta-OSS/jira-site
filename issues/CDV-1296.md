## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If you 
1. add some more classes to bootjar section in tc-config.xml 
2. or add a new TIM which adds classes to bootjar in its terracotta.xml 

Then you need to recreate the bootjar.  If you don't then you get the following error
BootJarException occurred while attempting to verify the contents of the boot jar. Unable to verify the contents of the boot jar; Please check the client logs for more information. 

If this happens we should drop and recreate the bootjar automatically.

Current workaround: Delete the bootjar and recreate 

</div>
