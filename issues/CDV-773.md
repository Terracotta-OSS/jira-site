2008-05-22 13:40:39,937 INFO - Unable to find communications stack. ConnectionID(0.6c11148a5b4a4387b450eaf493498be0) not found. This is usually caused by a client from a prior run trying to illegally
reconnect to the server. While that client is being rejected, everything else should proceed as normal.

Logs/tc-config.xml are attached.
