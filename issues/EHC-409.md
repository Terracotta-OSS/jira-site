## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It looks like the pom published with ehcache 1.6.2 (I see artifacts with both the old "ehcache" artifactId and the new "ehcache-core" artifactId) points to 2.0-SNAPSHOT parent pom.  This breaks Maven users as they typically point only at a released artifact repository and can't find the snapshot.  

See:
http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-releases/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache/1.6.2/ehcache-1.6.2.pom

Also shows up in the maven central lib.

Note the date of the artifacts: 23 September 2009. That is not the original release date. They have been overwritten by a maven run. That also explains why it has only recently been reported.

Checked out tag and re-ran mvn deploy.

Now fixed in sonatype and should propagate to central.

See the pom: http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-releases/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache/1.6.2/ehcache-1.6.2.pom

Greg, do you want to update on the ehcache mailing list about this?
