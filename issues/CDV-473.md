## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We have a problem that makes it difficult or impossible to get a kit and a maven release that "line up" wrt versions.  This makes it hard to get an Admin Console that doesn't complain about version mismatches, or for the Geronimo plugin (Orion should add details)

I'm resolving this as "won't fix" although technically it will be fixed with updates to the Terracotta API in forthcoming releases
