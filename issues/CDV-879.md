## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The cluster statistics recorder buffers all data locally on each node and sends the data out in batches to the gatherer on the TC server. During that time it needs the information of the active capturing session. However, when the session is stopped and all the data for it has been sent out, the session data itself should also be removed from the buffer. This isn't done currently.

The consumeStatistics method of H2StatisticsBufferImpl should know when all session data has been consumed and at that time clear the session information from capturesession.

Without doing this, it's not possible to re-use a capture session ID.

Calling reinitialize clears away all session data and makes it possible to re-use the same session ID.

Can't reproduce this... both 2.6.3 and 2.6.3 + patch 1 seem to show the same behavior:

macbook ~/\_\_releases/terracotta-2.6.3-ee/bin > ./tc-stats.sh startup createSession bar
> Started up.
> Session 'bar' created.
macbook ~/\_\_releases/terracotta-2.6.3-ee/bin > ./tc-stats.sh startCapturing
> Capturing started.
macbook ~/\_\_releases/terracotta-2.6.3-ee/bin > ./tc-stats.sh shutdown      
> Shutdown finished.
macbook ~/\_\_releases/terracotta-2.6.3-ee/bin > ./tc-stats.sh startup createSession bar
> Started up.
> Session 'bar' created.
macbook ~/\_\_releases/terracotta-2.6.3-ee/bin > ./tc-stats.sh startCapturing
> Capturing started.

from admin console:

What should I be doing differently?

If you retrieve the statistics after the 2nd capture, there will nothing be recorded.
