## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

See : http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/8303.page#39429
When offheap is full with only data present in the heap, it won't be able to evict anything. We could have a back off mechanism that will, in emergency, evict random things from heap. 
While this would still mean a badly configured cache, it might be useful. Still unsure myself though, i.e. the evicting of random stuff might actually cause more harm to the app itself... It just makes a misconfigured cache "less" obvious.

I have a fix for that, but given no one complained about that and it being so late in the release cycle; I'll commit that when we have trunk not being Wawona anymore.
