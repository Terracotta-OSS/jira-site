## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Up to now it is not possible to get rid of a declared root (and all connected objects) if you don't need it anymore.

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1620.page

It would be nice if there would be a command-line-tool or an option in the Admin Console, to delete a root completely. Another possibility would be to declare a root in tc-config as "obsolete".
