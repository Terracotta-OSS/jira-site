## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Now there is "diskStorePath - this parameter is ignored. CacheManager sets it using setter injection." in javaDoc of Cache constructor.
Why is it so?
I would like to set my own store path for each instance of Cache separately.
Thanks

Hi

Enough people as it is have trouble with the DiskStore path, particularly where this is multiple CacheManagers. The idea that database files go in a single place it pretty common. Of course there is also the tablespace idea where you can control at a table level where they go. Oracle has that. I think that is getting too sophisticated and complex for ehcache.
