## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It might (or it might not) be a good idea to support an embeddable server.  There are lots of arguments for and against, but this one is a good one.  It comes from Travell Perkins of Swerve:

Though Terracotta's nodes are not peer to peer it would be cool if the server could cleanly embed with a node-host. Then within cluster its a game of tag where a master is choosen.   In the even of failure another node becomes the master. 

In my particular organization you can pretty much add anything you want inside the application. Our techops is really only good at websphere and oracle. Its almost impossible to bring in new tech that might impact the topology. PoJoCache has the object identity without the topology impact. It is less flexible though, feels very much like Hibernate. :( 

Terracotta is very natural. Makes you better at coding concurrent programs. Wonderful software.  Embedding is definitely the way to go if possible.
