## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm seeing this occasionally come up while testing some stuff with EHC-421.  Stack trace:

Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException
	at java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.hash(ConcurrentHashMap.java:157)
	at java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.get(ConcurrentHashMap.java:730)
	at net.sf.ehcache.store.MemoryStore.findEvictionCandidate(MemoryStore.java:576)
	at net.sf.ehcache.store.MemoryStore.removeElementChosenByEvictionPolicy(MemoryStore.java:531)
	at net.sf.ehcache.store.MemoryStore.doPut(MemoryStore.java:461)
	at net.sf.ehcache.store.MemoryStore.put(MemoryStore.java:150)
	at net.sf.ehcache.Cache.put(Cache.java:872)
	at net.sf.ehcache.Cache.put(Cache.java:807)
	at net.sf.ehcache.jcache.JCache.put(JCache.java:637)
	at net.sf.ehcache.jcache.JCache.put(JCache.java:606)

Seems like MemoryStore.findEvictionCandidate() sampled eviction has some kind of race in it that can cause this.  At a glance, this looks like a race from the independent keyArray (AtomicReferenceArray) and keySamplePointer (AtomicInteger).  Could probably patch it with an NPE check and look at a better concurrency fix later.  We have similar logic in DistributedCache so that might be a source of ideas.

Should this be in 1.7.1?

I was able to reliably reproduce this with with JCacheTest and with the fix I can no longer reproduce it.  This is a race that can occur when a clear() comes in during a put() that causes eviction.  clear() clears the map but there is no synchronization between that and the updates of the keyArray.  Added a null check in the eviction algorithm is sufficient and equally valid.

Verified with the jcachetest. Now there is no NPE.
