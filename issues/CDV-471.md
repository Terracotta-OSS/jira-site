## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In active-passive mode, then one of the clients is killed, the passive server goes down with this exception :

The only way to have it back is to start it again.

Steps to reproduce :
start 2 servers
start 2 tomcat instances with TC\1CONFIG\1PATH="192.168.168.71:9510,192.168.168.70:9510"
kill one of the tomcats and watch the logs of the passive server

Retested this issue with rev 6252, it is working as expected. Closing this issue.

Steps:
1. Install the kit rev6252
2. Create the tc-config.xml to support network-based active passive server
mention active server: su10qa0, passive server: su10qa1, gc: on and persistence:on 
3. On su10qa0, Navigate to install-dir/bin and execute ./start-tc-server.sh -f tc-config.xml
4. Active server started successfully on su10qa0:9520
5. On su10qa1, Navigate to install-dir/bin and execute ./start-tc-server.sh -f tc-config.xml
6.Passive server started successfully on su10qa1:8520
7. Before starting the tomcat instances -> set the TC\1INSTALL\1DIR
8. set the TC\1CONFIG\1PATH="su10qa0:9510,su10qa1:9510"
9. set the bootjarpath
10. start the tomcat server instance 1 on su10qa6
11. start the tomcat server instance 2 on su10qa7
12. Verify that the two clients are displayed in the admin console
13. kill the tomcat 1

Actual: Active and passive servers are running without any issues
