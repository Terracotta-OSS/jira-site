## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Web Filters used to be included in the main ehcache jar. Now they seem to not be included anywhere. Looks like only way to get them is by building from the source.

Hi

They in their own module now called ehcache-web. For Maven they are in central. You can get them also from the ehcache repo here: http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/repository/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache-web/1.6.0-beta2/

You can download it from SourceForge here: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group\_id=93232&package\_id=318108

The reason for breaking this out is because there is a lot of stuff we want to do around it and this gives it its own release cycle.
