## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If you have an instance of TerracottaReadWriteLock or a TerracottaLock (constructed with an unshared lock object), and then call any of the lock() methods, and then either share the TRWL or share the underlying lock object for TerracottaLock -- you'll get exceptions on unlock(). 

In custom mode we disallow sharing of already locked RL and RRWL instances, although the check is racy

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I've added pre-create methods for the TerracottaReadWriteLock that throw IllegalStateException if the lock is in any way locked when it is added to clustered heap.  This gives us the same protection as the instrumented RRWL has in custom mode.

TerracottaLock does not require such a fix since it throws an IllegalArgumentException on construction if the supplied 'monitor' object is not clustered.
