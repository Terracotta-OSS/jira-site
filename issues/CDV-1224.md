## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Split-brain occurs when the L2 network is temporarily disrupted,  Each section of the disrupted network can wind up with its own Active L2 server.  When the network is reconnected, currently the server with the most active clients becomes the master.  The other server is stopped and restarted in Passive state, 

We would like there to be configurable options for how the split brain issue is resolved.  For our purposes we'd like to specify that a specific L2 server always becomes the master.  Others may prefer the existing method.  Still others might want to alert a human to resolve the issue.
