## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This only effects code compiled with 1.5 or greater I think. com.tc.object.bytecode.TransparencyCodeAdapter.handleJavaLangObjectMethodCall(int, String, String, String) is making a wrong assumption. The call to clone() is made directly to the array type. Example:

 public static void main(String[] args) \{
        String[] args2 = args.clone();
        System.err.println(args2);
  \}

If compiled with 1.4, the clone calls looks like this:
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, "java/lang/Object", "clone", "()Ljava/lang/Object;");

If compiled with 1.5, the clone calls looks like this:
mv.visitMethodInsn(INVOKEVIRTUAL, "[Ljava/lang/String;", "clone", "()Ljava/lang/Object;");

Since the call isn't direct to java.lang.Object we won't insert our magic wrapping that makes sure the element values are resolved (and done within the resolve lock)

This is definitely broken -- and now fixed in trunk. Need to merge to 3.0 when the branch is open
