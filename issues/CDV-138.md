## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The call made to resolveAllReferences before clone() is invoked, so that clone() will not see unresolved field values. Unforrunately there is a race condition with the memory manager. If the memory manager clears references before clone finishes, the cloned object might get bum field values. 

The fix is probably to hold the resolve lock for the duration of the clone() call

Steve thinks you are right, re: holding the resolve lock.  If you have time in Moraga to fix, do so, but it is a low priority.
