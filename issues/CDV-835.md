## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When an exception occurs while ModulesLoader is loading a TIM into the L1, the details of the exception are discarded and only a summary message is printed to the log: "BundleActivator start failed" for instance.

This makes it very difficult to debug problems with module loading.  The full details of the exception should be logged so that problems loading modules can be debugged by reading the log output.

NOTE: Be sure to test whether a call to a regular (ie. non-console) logger will have any effect here. It is possible (but I don't know either way) that the log file has not been opened yet and thus logging to a regular logger and calling System.exit() afterwards will lose the log statement.

Need to fix this as it has (multiple times) made it difficult and time-consuming to debug monkey issues.

if a tim is missing, we end up printing a duplicate message followed by a stacktrace

2009-03-27 13:33:52,387 FATAL - BootJarTool: Unable to resolve TIM file for tim-apache-struts-1.1 version 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT (group-id: org.terracotta.modules)

   Attempted to resolve the TIM using the following descriptors:

      groupId: org.terracotta.modules
      name   : tim-apache-struts-1.1
      version: 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT

   Expected the TIM's filename to be:

      tim-apache-struts-1.1-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

   Expected these attributes to be in the manifest:

      Bundle-SymbolicName: org.terracotta.modules.tim-apache-struts-1.1
      Bundle-Version     : 1.3.0.SNAPSHOT

   Searched using the following repositories:

      + /Users/nghani/__releases/mar23/terracotta-3.0.0-nightly-ee-rev12356/modules
      
   Tried to resolve the jar file using the following paths:

      + /Users/nghani/__releases/mar23/terracotta-3.0.0-nightly-ee-rev12356/modules/org/terracotta/modules/tim-apache-struts-1.1/1.3.0-SNAPSHOT/tim-apache-struts-1.1-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
      + /Users/nghani/__releases/mar23/terracotta-3.0.0-nightly-ee-rev12356/modules/tim-apache-struts-1.1-1.3.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
      
   If the jar file exists and is in one of the paths listed above, make sure that the Bundle-SymbolicName and
   Bundle-Version attribute in its manifest matches the ones that the resolver expects.

   If you do not have this particular TIM or any of its dependencies installed, try using the tim-get tool's 
   'install' command:

      $ tim-get.sh install tim-apache-struts-1.1 1.3.0-SNAPSHOT org.terracotta.modules

   You can also use the tool's 'list' command to see if it's actually available:

      $ tim-get.sh list tim-apache-struts-1.1   # list anything that has 'tim-apache-struts-1.1' in it's name
      $ tim-get.sh list                         # or, list everything that is available

   For more information on how to use the tim-get tool, invoke:
