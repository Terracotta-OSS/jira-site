## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When \{\{DefaultSizeOfEngine #sizeOf\}\} catches a \{\{MaxDepthExceededException\}\}, it logs it in a complex multi-line logging expression. The information that is logged isn't especially useful, though, and we find it often swamps the logs with unhelpful information.

Rather than try to come up with a generic, works-for-everyone log format, I thought the easiest first step is to perform the logging in a separate, protected method of \{\{DefaultSizeOfEngine\}\}, which allows custom \{\{SizeOfEngine\}\} implementations to override the logging to fit their own needs.

I've attached a patch that achieves this.

What do you want to achieve here that would not be achieved by improving the logging as requested in EHC-1056 and relying on configuring your logger to silence or not the log statements?

EHC-1056 would improve the general situation that would provide more useful logging in the majority of cases.  However, we have use-cases here that would involve digging into specific types to provide extended diagnostic information on the cause of the depth-exceeded exception. This by necessity would be application-specific code, and would require a subclass or re-implementation of \{\{DefaultSizeOfEngine\}\}.
