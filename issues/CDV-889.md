This page should be removed - it won't exist for 2.7.  It does exist (and works properly) in the old .org where it will live until 100% deprecated.

The instructions for getting SVT in the admin console should be updated to reflect that getting SVT is now a tim-get operation.

Gary updated the page to have the correct instructions. When orgstage is synched to live it will have the correct information

I've updated the reflector to point to this new page with the correct instructions.

the 2.6 kit will point to the old get svt page - http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/orgsite/Get+Snapshot+Visualization+Tool
