## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This might be a dup but putting in anyway...

We should change these messages to INFO:

2008-10-06 19:25:28,019 [TCWorkerComm # 1] WARN com.tc.bytes.TCByteBufferFactory - Asking for a large amount of memory: 115879345 bytes

Come up with a reasonable message if we leave it at WARN
