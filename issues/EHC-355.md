## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When cache writes output, it uses only OutputStream without BufferedOutputStream.

It can cause slowdown of response writing or possible loosing of data.

I've patched this file to use BufferedOutputStream.

I've tested this solution and it works fine.
