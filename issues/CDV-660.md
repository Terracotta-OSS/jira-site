## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I've gotten feedback that it would be helpful to have a zip file of a built maven archetype - not the maven archetype itself but the result of running the project.

This should make it easier to give someone a skeleton project.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

All the archetypes generate a POM that allows for this.
So after generating the project, they could do:

  mvn assembly:assembly

And it will generate a zip of the source and binary of the generated project in the target/site/downloads folder.
