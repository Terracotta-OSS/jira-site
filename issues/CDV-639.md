## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

install 2.5.2, run welcome screen, click on admin console.  You get an hourglass, but nothing happens.  However, the admin console will launch from the start menu.

Showed it to Gary.  He mentioned that you need the mouse to be perfectly still while clicking, but doing so still didn't work.

I just installed TC (2.6.2) on XP SP2 and get the admin console from the welcome screen (at both the end of the install and from the start menu).

This may be unrelated, but I have noticed a weird difference in the admin console launched from the start menu versus from the welcome screen:  the one from the start menu won't launch SVT (it just sends my browser to the get page).
