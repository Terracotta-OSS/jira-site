## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When ant was running the Cache tests
testExpiryBasedOnTimeToIdle and
testExpiryBasedOnTimeToIdleAfterPutQuiet, 
assertNull(cache.get("key1")); always failed, and I
notice a comment:
//Now, getQuiet and check still times out 2 seconds
after last get

There is a call to sleep(2001); just before this, I
assume the cache is supposed to remove the element 2
seconds after a get. But there's no guarantee that this
will happen at exactly 2 seconds, the jvm could be (and
probably is) doing something else, it only gets
\_scheduled\_ at 2 secconds. I've upped the sleep time to
2010 to improve the chance of that thread having run
before the assertion is checked.

This is a context diff rather than a unified diff,
sorry if that's a problem.
