## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is something that I've slowly seen happening but now it's even more evident on the second-level cache home panel. The window size that is required to see all the horizontal buttons is becoming too much, also there's very little indication that you're missing buttons when the window is too small. The smallest window width of the dev console that now shows all the buttons for me is 1331 pixels, imho that's not very user-friendly.

Imho we need to figure out a better way of using the screen estate in the dev console for action buttons like this.

Verified with 3.2.1\_2 kit and ehcache 2.1.0 kit, the hibernate and ehcache panels are added with tooltips and icons to solve the usability issue.
