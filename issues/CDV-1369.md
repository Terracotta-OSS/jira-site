## Description

It would seem com.tcclient.cache.CacheData should be exported from the bundle.

The user was modifying a collection containing EhCache entries, without proper locking.  He was using the DSO Eclipse plug-in so it was trying to gather up the context of the UnlockedSharedObjectException when this NoClassDefFoundError occurred because CacheData is not available outside the bundle.

The workarounds include: not using the DSO Eclipse plug-in, modifying tim-ehcache to export the type in question, or add proper locking around the modifying code.
