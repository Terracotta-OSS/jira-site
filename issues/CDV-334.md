## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If we do a poll on a shared LinkedBlockingQueue, the call never returns, even though we see items in the list via the Admin console.

There might not be a lot to work with here (maybe ask for more info, thread dump, etc), but this sounds like something you've dealt with in the past. 

I remember any issue a lot like this -- when was the fix made (ie. was it after 2.3.0)? If so, maybe going to 2.4 is the answer

I've not seen this and used both take and poll successfully.  Is the JVM that does the poll successfully connected to the cluster?  (E.g. are there two connected clients in the admin console)

What versions of OS, JVM, and Terracotta are being used? 

Is there any way to post code to reproduce this?

In adition to the information suggested by Taylor, how many nodes and how many threads per node are involved?

If you could post a thread dump when the poll() hangs, that would be very helpful.

This bug is created back in 2.3 about a year ago. Not sure if it still have this problem.
