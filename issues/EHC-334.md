## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Here is a proposed patch for making Element constructable from all fields that are not already configurable via setter methods. The justification for this is to allow querying/setting these fields in a persistable Store implementation, such as the JdbcStore I am working on. In this case I need to be able to store the Element fields as columns, and then re-create the Element from those columns.

Ok, accepted.

Can you please try and add sufficient tests for new functionality so that the test coverage does not drop. I created a new test for this change as follows:


    /\1\1
     \1 Tests that the full constructor sets everything right.
     \1/
    public void testFullConstructor() {

        Element element = new Element("key", "value", 1L, 123L, 1234L, 12345L, 123456L, 1234567L);
        assertEquals("key", element.getKey());
        assertEquals("value", element.getValue());
        assertEquals(1L, element.getVersion());
        assertEquals(123L, element.getCreationTime());
        assertEquals(1234L, element.getLastAccessTime());
        assertEquals(12345L, element.getNextToLastAccessTime());
        assertEquals(123456L, element.getLastUpdateTime());
        assertEquals(1234567L, element.getHitCount());

    }

It gives me confidence to make changes given that I don't have formal testers and rely on beta users as testers, so I try and have high coverage using unit, integration, performance, multithreaded... tests.
