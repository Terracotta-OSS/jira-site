## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the second-level cache configuration section, the entity names are incorrectly shortened.

See the picture.  For some reason, the first part is truncated.

The expected values should be:

o.t.r.e.d...

but they are 

t.r.e.d...

</div>

Note the first picture is attached to show the entities as displayed in the Hibernate entities screen, which are displayed correctly.
