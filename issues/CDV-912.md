just had this happen again on mac osx (linux). not sure this warrants a bug since my setup may not be a likely one for developers/opertators, but just in case....


1. ran welcome.sh
2. ran samples app (sample server starts)
3. opened admin console, a client or two, then left machine alone
4. mac wants to go dormant and starts shutting apps down, and it successfully shuts down admin console, clients, samples app, welcome app
5. mac stuck on closing down terminal, so doesn't go dormant
6. reopen all those tc tools, including samples app, which tries to run samples server, but reports that a server is already running on that port

original samples server was still running.

just reproduced it again more directly:

1. ran welcome.sh
2. ran samples app (sample server starts)
3. opened admin console, connect to server
4. close samples app, welcome app -- server continues to appear in admin console 
5. close and reopen admin console, connect to server -- continues to appear in admin console

This is a Mac vs. Java thing.  

If you close the Sample Application Launcher by using the close box in the window, or using the file menu in the window, then the launcher shuts down the server before it goes away.  

If you use <cmd>Q or the menu bar menu to quit the launcher, then it leaves the server running in the background.  The problem here is the launcher does not catch those quit events, so, it does not shut down the server before the launcher dies.

so it is not going to happen on Windows?
Is <cmd>Q the same as the Mac going to sleep/dormant?
Can you confirm with Igal how he closed the window? thanks

Please Doc in known issues. We can probably move this to CDV as well.

We will not fix the Java/Mac OS weirdness. A known issue was added to Release Notes on orgstage today.
