## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a Cache instance which is overflow-to-disk is
disposed off through Cache.dispose() the
DiskStore.dispose() is called which cleans up the disk
store. Unlike the MemoryStore.dispose() method the
DiskStore.dispose() method does not set the Cache
instance to null.

It would probably be better to drop the respective
reference. Interestingly the DiskStore instances turn
into GC Root objects of type "local stack" (please
forgive my ignorance, I am not very sure what this
actually means, but it seems that for this reason the
DiskStore and Cache objects cannot be collected).

Attached is a simple patch, which sets the cache field
to null when the DiskStore is diposed.
