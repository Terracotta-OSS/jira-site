## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This issue comes form a forum posting. 

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/904.page

In large coding projects where Ehcache is used often it's dangerous to assume that CacheManger.getInstance() and CacheManger.create() calls should automatically get included into terracotta. It's especially hard to manage this when 3rd party libraries use Ehcache and never intended to have those caches distributed.

"I'd like to suggest that this be over-ridable in the future. I don't think it's acceptable for myself or anyone else to have to maintain there own private branch of tim-ehcache for something so simple. It's pretty hard to enforce that all your dependencies avoid using the singleton behavior of Ehcache. Regardless of whether your dependencies are in-house or third party it's to dangerous."
