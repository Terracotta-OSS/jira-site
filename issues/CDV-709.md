## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I've been trying to edit some tc configs that had the following schema declaration and xml editors can't resolve it from this declaration:

<tc:tc-config xmlns:tc="http://www.terracotta.org/config">

Then I've tried to use full declaration, but apparently it is pointing to the outdated xsd that does not have new statisics elements:

<tc:tc-config xmlns:tc="http://www.terracotta.org/config"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.terracotta.org/config http://www.terracotta.org/schema/terracotta-4.xsd">


</div>

I just pushed the new schema. Would you give it another try?

Thanks Hung. The explicit schema location seem to work now. I wonder if we can make it work for the namespace http://www.terracotta.org/config only.

Hung is there another issue that needs to be addressed?

no. Since we didn't publish 2.6-stable0 Eclipse plugin, we didn't publish the schema either, which we should have. So just remember to upload the schema whether or not we publish Eclipse plugin.
