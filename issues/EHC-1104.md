here continues the description:

Commiting all the 200k together takes 8 minutes; for test purposes I split the transaction in commit size of 500, 1000, up to 200k. The reported times below are those needed to commit all the 200k objects, by commit chuck size:

commit size - seconds
10			48,87
100			17,22
500			15,77
1.000		14,33
5.000		20,43
10.000		26,89
20.000		32,14
30.000		47,53
40.000		55,71
50.000		74,13
75.000		104,52
100.000		163,57
125.000		154,68
150.000		263,94
175.000		277,11
200.000		460,34

I was expecting to get performance degration for increasing commit size, but I feel that commit time increases too quickly. I was expecting that a 200MB commit would take some seconds, not some minutes.

M.Antonelli

One more note: changing the transactial mode from "xa\_strict" to "xa" does not change significantly the timings.
