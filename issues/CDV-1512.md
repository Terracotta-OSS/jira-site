## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If someone uses classes named the same at the java primitive types (eg. "int", "void", "char", etc) in the default package space, those types will fail to serialize in the toolkit 

relates to DEV-4694

This test contains a method to show this issue -- see method testFunnyIntType()
./toolkit-impl/src/test/java/org/terracotta/cache/serialization/ObjectStreamClassSerializerTest.java

Given the brokenness of such bizarro classes with regular java serialization I don't think we need to bend over backwards to support them in our serialization mechanisms
