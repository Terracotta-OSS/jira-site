## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Product.java contains a public non-final field for price.  In general this isn't a very good practice, but with Terracotta it's particularly bad.

Product.java needs to be rewritten so that there are proper getters and setters for the price, with synchronization and a read-lock for the getter.  I also don't agree with the particular code style for the setter which could be re-written as a synchronized method call. 

</div>
