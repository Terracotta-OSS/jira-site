## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In RMIBootstrapCacheLoader the list keys of all keys is
fetched from a random CachePeer. Later the Elements
belonging to those keys are fetched in chunks.
These elements could meanwhile have expired at the 
CachePeer.
If this is the case a null element is in the received
chunk. Since it is not allowed to put null elements in
the cache these elements must be ignored.

See attached patch which also helps to generate a
backtrace in case of an exception during bootstrap.
The discovered cache peers are also logged in debug 
level.

Shouldn't the log level of errors during bottstrap be increaed?

Thanks for the patch. It is in trunk and will be in ehcache-1.3.0. 

I have increased the bootstrap error to warn. The reason it is not higher is that I have been sort of thinking of bootstrapping as a performance optimisation. If it fails there is no harm done. It is also a relatively new and somewhat experimental feature which is not widely used as of yet compared with the other parts of replication.

Thanks for both of your patches.
