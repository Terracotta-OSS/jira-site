## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, when a cache is disabled in Ehcache, puts are dropped but gets return as normal which seems weird.  In meeting of Dec 2, '09 we decided get()s should return null when cache is disabled instead.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

This is pretty much done as part of the dynamic configuration changes.  The only remaining element is to guard against enable/disable when a key is locked when running as a hibernate cache, there is a solution for the same problem in tim-hibernate-cache which needs to be pulled across into the Ehcache hibernate cache provider as part of my work on that.
