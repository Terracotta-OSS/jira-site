## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

we could make specifying modules easier by making the version default to the version of tc used to load the config. This would make upgrades easier as the required module version would move with the tc upgrade.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I don't get it.  Aren't there many possible module versions for a particular tc version?  I don't see how to figure even that out much less which one is the "right" one.  Can you give a more specific example?

</div>
