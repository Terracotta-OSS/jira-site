This appears to be an issue with the installer itself and 64 bit windows.
The Terracotta Server Array has not been tested on 64 bit Windows http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Platform+Support

I have added a Jira to track votes anyone may  have on supporting 64 bit Windows CDV-1255, feel free to vote on it.

Also as the issue here is with the installer.jar, you should be able to use the Generic Archive without a problem http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/DownloadCatalog
