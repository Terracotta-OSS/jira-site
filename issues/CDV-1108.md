## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

l2.nha.dirtydb.autoDelete = true
l2.nha.autoRestart = true

Dirty Dbs are moved to backup directory, when they are found to be problamatic during the server boot-up. These backups can grow over time. A Roll back mechanism is needed, by which, old backups can be removed safely.

l2.nha.dirtydb.rolling = <count>
  if <count> is 0, the default behaviour of countless backups will happen.
