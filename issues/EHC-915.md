## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://www.ehcache.org/documentation/user-guide/hibernate

With the new global pool of object (specifing the total memory size instead of the size of each cache size) in ehCache 2.5, specifing that the cache should not expired is not enough. The cache may be cleared if the other caches are used. It is important to pinned the cache, to ensure it won't be clear. We could be confident that, even with the cache spinned, it won't explode, since the number of hibernate "space" is not infinite.

<ehcache maxBytesLocalHeap="500M">
<cache name="org.hibernate.cache.UpdateTimestampsCache" eternal="true" overflowToDisk="false">
<pinning store="inCache" />
</cache>
</ehcache>

I already commented a ticket on Hibernate JIRA for the same issue, since the doc exists on both side :
https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-4550?focusedCommentId=45170&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-45170

Can you confirm that this is the correct info to document? If so please reassign to Docs Team

Looks like this bit on "UpdateTimestampsCache" would need a note stating that if you use ARC at the CacheManager level, you want to pin this cache.
Always pinning it wouldn't hurt, but I expect it to be sized accordingly. Now when you use CacheManager level ARC, the pool could decide to evict from that cache (now, knowing the current impl. I believe this to be very unlikely).

There is a note about this in source docs which should be published shortly.
