## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Ehcache v1.4.0-beta:

net.sf.ehcache.event.RegisteredEventListeners is not thread-safe.  We are receiving the following exception after a put() operation while another thread is registering a new listener:


java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
 at java.util.HashMap$HashIterator.nextEntry(HashMap.java:793)
 at java.util.HashMap$KeyIterator.next(HashMap.java:828)
 at net.sf.ehcache.event.RegisteredEventListeners.notifyElementPut(RegisteredEventListeners.java:100)
 at net.sf.ehcache.Cache.put(Cache.java:677)
 at net.sf.ehcache.Cache.put(Cache.java:618)
 ...


Looking at the source, there is nothing that we can synchronize on to provide thread-safety.  Also, because RegisteredEventListeners is not an interface as is declared final, there is no way to inject a thread-safe replacement implementation into Cache.

Our application is highly concurrent application and relies cache listeners.

Please let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Geoff.
