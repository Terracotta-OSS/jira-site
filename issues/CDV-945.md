## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

On Ubuntu, /bin/sh is linked to 'dash'

dso-java.sh fails to run under dash, complaining about: dso-java.sh: 14: Syntax error: "(" unexpected

the line in question is:
ARGS=($\*)

making the script explicitly depend upon bash fixes the problem.

This issue has popped up more often now and the the fix is real simple. Just explicitly set all our scripts to use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh. That will work in all platforms, even Solaris.

I still haven't gotten a \*solid\* answer to this question:

do our scripts work with a real /bin/sh interpreter, or are they "sh incompatible" or are they only "dash incompatible" (we've already established that they are "bash compatible")

I believe they're sh incompatible and dash incompatible.

Obvious bashisms have been removed from the two offending scripts (dso-java.sh and start-tc-server.sh) with the help of the Debian checkbashisms tool.  If more are discovered they should be easy and quick to fix.

Can we merge this to 2.7 branch as well?

dso-java.sh failed in Solaris

bin/dso-java.sh: syntax error at line 14: \`ARGS=' unexpected

------------

To reproduce, download 2.7.1 kit and change this in run.sh under inventory demo:

exec $TC\_INSTALL\_DIR/bin/dso-java.sh $JAVA\_OPTS -cp "$\{CWD\}/classes" demo.inventory.Main $ARGS
#exec "$\{JAVA\_HOME\}/bin/java" $\{TC\_JAVA\_OPTS\} $\{JAVA\_OPTS\} \
#  -cp "$\{CWD\}/classes" demo.inventory.Main $ARGS

workaround:  change /bin/sh in dso-java.sh to  /bin/bash

this was fixed in trunk but wasn't merged into 2.7.  I have merged the fix from trunk to 2.7, r10770
