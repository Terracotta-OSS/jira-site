## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Why is net.sf.ehcache.enableShutdownHook a system property and a hibernate configuration option? It seems like it should be a hibernate configuration option, given that all of the other ehcache cache properties are passed in this way.

this is a question, not a bug.

lots of things must be configured outside of the hibernate config.

Most people want this turned off because their other software already has shutdown bugs.
