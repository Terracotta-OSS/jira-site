## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Now that Eclipse 3.4 is out, the plug-in needs to be changed to work with it.  A previously private type has been promoted to public and since it needs to be extended there is no other choice but to make the change and support 3.4 going forward.

It's a trivial change but the result is that Eclipse releases prior to 3.4 will no longer be supported.

Taylor agrees that we should go forward with this. Understands that 3.3 will not be supported.

The work on this is done. IMO, this change should be merged to 2.6 if the patch process changes are also moved to 2.6, because there are some intertwined changes.
