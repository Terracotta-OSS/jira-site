## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It is been agreed that we should always explicitly specify all versions and also use -SNAPSHOTS between releases, but it doesn't seem like it been changed in existing modules, except that tcbuild is adding -SNAPSHOT suffix to the nightly build jars deployed to maven repo. This last piece is most troublesome because module versions have 1.0.0, but artifacts deployed to maven repository are using version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.

Versions should be explicitly specified in tc.properties and module manifests:

l1.configbundles.default = excludes-config,1.0.0-SNAPSHOT;guimodels-config,1.0.0-SNAPSHOT;jdk15-preinst-config,1.0.0-SNAPSHOT;spring-config,1.0.0-SNAPSHOT;standard-config,1.0.0-SNAPSHOT

 Bundle-SymbolicName: org.terracotta.modules.clustered-hibernate-3.1.2
 Bundle-Version: 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT
 Require-Bundle: org.terracotta.modules.modules\_common;bundle-version="1.0.0.SNAPSHOT",
    org.terracotta.modules.clustered-cglib-2.1.3;bundle-version="1.0.0.SNAPSHOT" 

We'll have to match 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT version in module bundle with 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT version used in jar file names and Maven artifact versions.

Can you verify that this is how everything works now?
