any attempt to run mvn tc:run with latest build will fail:


$ svn co https://svn.terracotta.org/repo/forge/projects/labs/tim-guice 
$ cd tim-guice 
$ mvn install 
$ cd sample 

edit pom to change maven version from 1.0.5 to 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT 

$ mvn package 
$ mvn tc:start 
$ mvn tc:run

This was a temporary failure caused by the new tc-l1-prop-from-l2 artifact not having been published to our Maven repository.
