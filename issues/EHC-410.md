## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Had some conversation a while back about adding a new feature to the CacheManager to capture Terracotta cluster events (nodes joining, leaving, etc) similar to our existing cluster events API.

W.r.t 

Prospects/customers would care about cluster events, any account/use case that is choosing us for reliability and ease of management to handle failures would want the cluster events to work. 

The scope of this would be across the cache continuum, but cluster events do not work only in express.

In terms of priority, I would say Consistency to the DB (currently provided through H2LC) and this would be on par. Next would be Express for Web Sessions.
