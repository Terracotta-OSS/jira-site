## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently the ehcache-terracotta clustered store does not notify any listeners on eviction.  It should at least notify the local cache event listener that eviction has occurred.  

Separate jiras will cover clustered notification.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The eviction occurs in the underling DistributedCacheImpl.evict().  In Ehcache, a subclass of DistributedCacheImpl called ClusteredStoreBackend is being used underneath the ClusteredStore (underneath the Ehcache Cache object ...whew).

DistributedCacheImpl could have an empty method onEvict() (or something like that) that is overridden in ClusteredStoreBackend.  ClusteredStore could pass cache.getCacheEventNotificationService() to the ClusteredStoreBackend so that CSBE could call the RegisteredEventListeners.notifyElementEvicted() method.  

Need some tests for this too of course in both express (terracotta-ehcache) and custom (tim-ehcache) deployments.
