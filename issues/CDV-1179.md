## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Eclipse plugin does properly handle aspect subtype patterns (e.g., Foo+)

1.	Create classes: C1, C2, C3 (see attached)
2.	Instrument classes as follows:
	- For classes matching expression: C1+
	- honor transient
	- defined on-load method = restoreTransient
3.	Use GUI, mark following as DSO roots: C1.ROOT, C2.ROOT, C3.ROOT
	C2 + C3 will show up in "Instrumented classes - Includes" in DSO Config view
4.	Delete C2 + C3 from "Includes classes - Includes"
	C2 + C3 no longer marked w/ red-checks ... even though they \*are\* instrumented.
5.	Run main() method for all classes.  No exceptions are thrown.
6.	Run main() method for all classes again.  No exceptions are thrown.

Expected results:
-----------------

1.  Step 4 should not be necessary to get tests to pass.  If omitted, step 6 will throw exception for C2 + C3 ... indicating that those classes are \*not\* instrumented properly

2.	C2 + C3 should not lose red-checks at step 4.  They should be covered by C1+ rule.

Attached is the tc-config.xml that works (step 4 in reproduce case is done)

Attached is the tc-config.xml that does \*not\* work (step 4 in reproduce case is skipped).  Using this "normal" tc-config.xml, the following exception occur during step 6 of reproduce case:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: test failed for C2@5373c8
	at C1.test(C1.java:15)
	at C2.main(C2.java:6)

and

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: test failed for C3@1a82499
	at C1.test(C1.java:15)
	at C3.main(C3.java:6)

</div>

Step 5 + 6 in reproduce case should also say:

The following dialog appears when running main, but they are apparently harmless (C1+ rule is apparently applied to C2 + C3)
[quote]
	There are problems with the Terracotta configuration.  Continue?

	Root type 'C2' not instrumented
	Root type 'C3' not instrumented

	[OK] [Cancel]

Clarification: Problem w/ this bug is that Eclipse plugin adds too much to the instrumented class list.  Coupled w/ issue CDV-1178, this makes on-load behavior hard to customize. :(

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Yes, I meant "not handle".  Can the title + description be corrected?
