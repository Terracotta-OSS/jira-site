## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I wrote a class that overrode the hashcode method and used this class as keys for a ConcurrentHashMap.

I remember getting an NPE that appeared to be in DSO code.

I am putting this bug in as a placeholder for now - when I get a chance I will try to write some code to repro it.

Can you test overriding hashcode?

I think the code was something like:

public class Foo
\{
  Object a = new Object();
  Object b = new Object();

  ...

  public int hashcode() \{ return a.hashcode(); \}
\}

We have a test ConcurrentHashMapTestApp that does this and it works fine.

ConcurrentHashMapTestApp doesnt do exactly this. I am assigning it to Antonio for investigation.

Can you give the test code ? I am not sure why an NPE will be thrown. According to Antonio, a NPE is thrown since the test program assumes that it gets back a value.

For example,

Foo f1 = new Foo();
concurrentMap.put(f1, new Value());
Foo f2 = new Foo();
Value value =  (Value) concurrentMap.get(f2);
print(value.toString());

The above code will throw NPE because the get() wont return the right value. This is true even in regular JAVA since a.hashcode() will return different value in  f1 and f2. 

If this is the case, it is not a bug and this issue can be closed.
