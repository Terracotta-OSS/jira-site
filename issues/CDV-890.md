This is as designed - changing the trace depth resets the stats.

The initial root locks that you saw will not be accessed again by that same client - so the second view is a view only of the locks acquired during the current "session".

I have had a similar issue trying to remember if trace depth changes reset the stats - even though I helped design it!  I think we need to make the UI more clear on this point.

So - while it's working as designed - I would agree with you that the operation is obscure.
