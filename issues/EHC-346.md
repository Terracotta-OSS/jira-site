You are the first to report this. You must be hammering those caches. We run it in production for weeks and do not see it.

I have changed the internal storage to long. To preserve backward compatibility I have deprecated the direct getters on cache and added a warning that the values can 
overflow. The Statistics class has also been changed to longs and you can get longs from there. That should work better for existing users as Statistics is a new class and I 
suspect less people are using it.

Let me know if this does not work for you.
