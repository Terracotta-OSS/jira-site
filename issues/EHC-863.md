## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Maybe introducing a RegisteredEventListeners.getCacheEventListeners(NotificationScope): Set<CacheEventListener> would make sense here...

From the dev ML:
Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on using EhCache 2.4.2, and setting up CacheEventListeners to propagate events to different VMs. I'm also using a single cache configuration, which is cloned to create an instance of each of my domain objects.

I noticed that when cloning Cache objects, the CacheEventListeners get cloned, but with the default "ALL" NotificationScope. Here is a simple JUnit test that exhibit this behavior, added to the CacheTest suite:
/\*\*
\* Tests that when cloning a cache, the notification scope for any registered listener is also
\* applied to the clone.
\*/
@Test
public void testCloningCacheKeepsNotificationScope() throws CloneNotSupportedException \{
// Create the source cache, register a listener
Cache cache = new Cache("testCloningCacheKeepsNotificationScope", 10, false, false, 100, 200);
cache.getCacheEventNotificationService().registerListener(new RemoveCountingListener(), NotificationScope.LOCAL);

// Clone the cache, access the cloned listener
Cache cloned = cache.clone();
cloned.setName("testCloningCacheKeepsNotificationScopeClone");
assertEquals("The cloned cache should have only one registered listener", 1, cloned.getCacheEventNotificationService().getCacheEventListeners().size());
RemoveCountingListener clonedListener = (RemoveCountingListener) cloned.getCacheEventNotificationService().getCacheEventListeners().iterator().next();

manager.addCache(cache);
manager.addCache(cloned);

// Put an element
Element element = new Element("foo", "bar", 1L);
cloned.put(element);

// Remove an element - only listeners with notification scope "REMOTE" should be notified
cloned.remove("foo", true);
assertEquals("The cloned listener was notified of the event even though its scope should be LOCAL", 0, clonedListener.count);
\}

The final test fails because the clonedListener instance has been registered with the ALL scope. Did I miss something or is there an issue ?

In the later case, I don't know if it's the proper issue reporting process, but I'm attaching a patch I'm using to get around it for now.

Regards,

Julien MASSENET

Here's my quick take on the issue, adding RegisteredEventListeners.getCacheEventListeners(NotificationScope notificationScope): Set<CacheEventListener> 
Probably needs a finer review though...

Assigned to Greg for review.
We also need a signed contributor agreement from Julien to accept this patch. Do we have his contact information?

I personally don't like his patch so much though, I tend to prefer my approachâ€¦ obviously! ;-)
I'll let Greg decide what the best approach would be. I created this jira based on him mailing the ML, so his contact is there.

1. EHC-863.patch is my take on it
2. scope.diff is his initial patch

He posted two additional patches based on my feedback on the ML as well.

Attached are two possible updated pacthes:
 - [^EHC-863-solution1.diff]: essentially a simplified version of the previous one with better naming.
 - [^EHC-863-solution2.diff]: a solution based on Alex Snaps's feedback - in this one, the copyInto method gets passed an instance of RegisteredEventListeners.

In addition, I just sent in the completed contributor agreement.
