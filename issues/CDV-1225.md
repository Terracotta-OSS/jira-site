## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If a user is pushing instance of byte[] into a tccache, we'll end up serializing it (to another byte[]). Although we shouldn't just take the byte[] raw from the application, it would probably be faster and create less garbage to either clone() or use System.arraycopy to "serialize" it in on put() (same thing for get())

I wonder if we should have an immutable put of some sort where we could avoid the copy completely

If one puts a byte array and it is immutable, knowing that means we don't have to copy it. If we don't know that the bytearray is immutable we do have to copy it.

So the suggestion here is that there is a specific method (eg. putImmutable()) that an application can use to express that the value will not be mutated (an array is always mutable). 

I think this suggestion could fall under the category of configuring the cache instance as a whole to not copy on put() and/or get(). It is less safe but could be a way for people to get performance as a tradeoff.

+1 to that - I think it should be a config option.  would be nice to just set up caches containing pre-serialized object byte[] and completely avoid the copy or need for special methods.
