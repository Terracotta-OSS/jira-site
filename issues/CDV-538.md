## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If one shares an instance of some application scoped class (ie. something that is part of your .war, not in CLASSPATH), and then the app is hot re-deployed...the user will almost certainly be rewarded with ClassCastException. For example, if some servlet in a web app sticks an instance of some application class (say an inner class of the servlet) in shared map (a DSO root)....if that app is redeployed, the servlet will come up, try to access the root, and the instance of the inner class (which is still memory resident) will be from the prior app instance classloader...ClassCastException. 

One solution (there might be others) is to flush any and all resident shared objects defined by the app being re-deployed. This implies some form of hook to the app lifecycle, and a way to crawl the space of local DSO objects looking for particular loaders.
