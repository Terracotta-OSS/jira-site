## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

To move sessions to distributed cache infrastructure, need to have evictor be able to tryLock before evicting an entry.  Right now, this is done in  sessions to  prevent an entry from being evicted even if in a long use pattern (> TTI).

we're not moving sessions to distributed cache in 3.3.0, so moving this to next release

Please link and mark as dup of the jira to make sessions use ehcache

We are not doing it in 3.5 either. Can't find the 'related' or duplicate jira. So just moving this out.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

OpenJPA needs a "pinning" API, so that an element can be pinned in memory. And I have a vague recollection of reported issues where we evict something that Hibernate has a softlock on during it's transactions. We should look comprehensively at all of our pinning requirements when implementing this.

This issue is essentially a moot point, I imagine that long running sessions will be saved from the evictor by being pinned (pinning is currently planned for the next major release of Ehcache).
