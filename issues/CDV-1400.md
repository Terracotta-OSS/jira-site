## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

2009-10-01 08:51:33,404 INFO - Terracotta 3.1.0, as of 20090820-100801 (Revision 13440 by cruise@su10mo5 from 3.1)


This may be due to my recent update to Snow Leopard.

See attached screenshot - the UI for the select view node is not showing up and does not respond to clicks.

The selected tree node on the left in this case was for runtime-statistics.
