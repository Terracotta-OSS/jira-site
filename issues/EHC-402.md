## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

As opposed to DistributedCache, when using Ehcache as a front, the memory size can't ever be infinite. The maximum size is always passed in and takes effect even if it's 0. This turns the maximum cache size into Integer.MAX\1SIZE (2147483647).

```
    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory.  0 = no limit.
    In practice no limit means Integer.MAX\1SIZE (2147483647) unless the cache is distributed
    with a Terracotta server in which case it is limited by resources.
```
