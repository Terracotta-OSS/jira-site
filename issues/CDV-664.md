## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Looks like the common maven case may not work well with statistics gathering.  or it may be that some variables are not set when maven is running that the stats gathering expects. 

See this thread for the error:

Is there any way to hard disable the entire stats system?  Maybe we should have a property that does this since it seems we try to write a file?

And is that file location configurable?  If not it somewhat violates our policy that we never require the tc install dir to be have write permissions.

Actually there are two errors in there:

1. statistics gatherer not starting, that's no problem, it will just be disabled
2. DSO http server not starting up since it's looking for tc.install-root instead of user.home as resource base (this is a change I made). I'm making this more permissive. I thought tc.install-root was always set when ran outside tests

I'll commit a fix in 30 mins or so

Btw, yeah the file location is totally configurable through tc-config.xml
