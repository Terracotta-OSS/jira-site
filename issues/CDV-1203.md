## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Spring and boolean literals does not have same behavior as it was described in Terracotta documentation: Once assigned value for shared literal can not be changed anymore.

Workaround: In my case I used int literals as root - they had appropriate behavior as was wrote in Terracotta documentation.

since cdv-948 is still open, i'd like engg to clarify this. it sounds like the user is saying that "Spring literals" (what are those? did he mean String?) and Boolean literals are not reassignable, but that ints are. that last seems to contradict something that was said in cdv-948, but i'm not sure.

so engg please clarify: which literals are reassignable, which are not?
