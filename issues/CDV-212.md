## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The support for org.mortbay.start.Classpath$Loader is not as clean as I would prefer. I changed Classpath.getClassLoader() to do the loader naming on the returned loader. That method is called more than once during startup, so more than one instance ends up being named and registered with DSO. It just happens that the last one created is the one that actually starts the server

This should be cleaned up somehow, it is fragile
