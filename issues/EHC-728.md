## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We're still using tim-ehcache-2.0 to run with ehcache-core-2.1.0

That doesn't look right version and convention wise

No, it's not messed up, this is simply the name of the tim artifact. There's no different for the implementation between the Ehcache TC support for 2.0 and 2.1. If we start tracking the exact version number of ehcache in the tim artifact name, then we constantly need to create new versions and releases also.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

we've never really had a good answer to this issue. I agree that using tim-ehcache-2.0 with ehcache-core-2.1.x is confusing (even if it works fine). 

This issue should probably be raised a little higher to have someone tell us what to do. If nothing else we can create tim-ehcache-2.1 which is empty and just depends on tim-ehcache-2.0. We do that in other places.

Maybe we should renamed tim-ehcache-2.0 into tim-ehcache-2.x and create a new one in case a later 2.y becomes incompatible?
