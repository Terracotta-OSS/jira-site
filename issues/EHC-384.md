## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The ehcache-terracotta module installs with mvn install but does not deploy with mvn deploy. You need to install it and then you can build the ehcache module. That needs to be fixed.

This needs to be fixed so that we can deploy it to sonatype.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Due to the way that the ehcache-terracotta artifact is assembled, you must activate a profile to deploy to the Sonatype repo.  This is the "ugly hack" discussed in an e-mail thread about ehcache-terracotta deployment.

These are the available deploy profiles:

deploy-to-kong (deploys to the Terracotta Maven repository)
deploy-snapshot-default (deploys to sourceforge-snapshots repository)
deploy-release-default (deploys to sourceforge-releases repository)

The automated publication system activates the deploy-to-kong and deploy-snapshot-default profiles.  When it is time to deploy a release, it will require activating the deploy-release-default profile.
