## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Anonymous users checking out and building ehcache (svn co http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/ehcache && mvn clean install) are not able anymore to compile and run the system-tests module.
This module depends on transactions-jta:3.6.5 which used to be fetched from the atomikos maven repository.
But this repo is not public anymore : http://blog.atomikos.com/2012/12/atomikos-maven-repository-now-open-to-customers-only/
We should stop relying on this repo, and rely on Maven central instead (and downgrade the dependency to 3.6.4 since 3.6.5 is not pushed to maven central and 3.8.0 changed the API).

I hope downgrading won't be a problem as I remember fighting with some atomikos bugs that forced me to upgrade several times...

Removed atomikos repo from system-tests/pom.xml and modified version to 3.6.4 from Maven Central.  Tests out good when building externally.
