## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

See attached test.  To repro untar:

$ mvn tc:start
$ mvn tc:run
$ mvn tc:run

The second run will attempt to read the object (a hand coded linked list 5 elements long) and clone it.  It will print the read object, and the cloned object.  Here are the results:

[INFO] [node] org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@5e32f9 : org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@5e32f9 : org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@5e32f9 : org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@5e32f9 : org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@5e32f9 : org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@5e32f9
[INFO] [node] org.terracotta.sample.Main$Linked@55c37d

The second output should have been 5 elements long like the first.

I notice that the example works correctly if you System.out.println the object BEFORE cloning it.  I'm guessing there's a problem in serializing a clustered object before it is faulted into the L1 node.

Also, there's a minor bug in the print() method - you want to do buffer.append(current) rather than buffer.append(this).
