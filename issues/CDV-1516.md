## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I couldn't find any detailed doc about where to set sessionLocking, synchronousWrite in session Express. I was told they are part of <Valve> for Tomcat. It will good to have detailed doc for all available options for all supported containers.

Thanks!

These two items are buried in the Configuration Guide and Reference and should probably also be in the chapter on session in the product docs. I think it's the \{\{session-locking\}\} and \{\{synchronous-write\}\} attributes (of <web-application>) that are being talked about here.

That part of Configuration Guide only works for tc-config.xml for DSO mode.
In Express, client should not even use any tc-config.xml.

Am I missing anything?

Thanks!

Right, for DSO it's in
tc-config.xml:

  <web-application session-locking="false"
synchronous-write="true">myapp</web-application>

For standard clusters, these two attributes are in the valve or filter. These will be added to the product docs.

Tomcat-based sessions:

  <Valve className="com.terracotta.XXX" tcConfigUrl="localhost:9510"
         sessionLocking="true" synchronousWrite="true"/>

For filter-based sessions:


  <filter>
    <filter-name>terracotta-filter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.terracotta.session.TerracottaJetty61xSessionFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>tcConfigUrl</param-name>
      <param-value>localhost:9510</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>sessionLocking</param-name>
      <param-value>true</param-value>
    </init-param>
  <init-param>
      <param-name>synchronousWrite</param-name>
      <param-value>true</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </filter>
