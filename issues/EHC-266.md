## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We are including CachingFilter to cache/gzip static files (javascript, css) in some projects, and have run into two issues:

1.- Gzipping content is not recommended for contents that are not text:
http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#gzip

It seems it would be better to only gzip contents with a Content-Type header of text/\*

2.- For projects that do not have ehcache configured (a common case), it would be nice to automatically detect it and generate a default configuration with reasonable defaults for web access.

I suppose (2) is a matter of taste, but (1) seems like a good addition to the framework. Regards,

Ignacio.
