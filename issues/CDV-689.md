## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I get this on the L2 console when an L1 exits:

Apr 1, 2008 7:09:08 PM ClientCommunicatorAdmin restart
WARNING: Failed to restart: java.io.IOException: connection closed

This doesn't seem to be going through log4j, as it has the wrong format, and an L1 exiting is a normal condition, so I wouldn't expect any messages other than a DEBUG level, maybe INFO, but that seems incorrect.  Even so, this message is cryptic and makes no sense.
