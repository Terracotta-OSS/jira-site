## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We have generic error handling code that can get executed by the standalone hibernate client that will try to load jetty classes. Since we strip the jetty jars from the standalone packaging this code that is trying to handle some arbitrary exception ends up throwing ClassNotFoundException. There is an error in the error handling :-). 

com.tc.lang.ThrowableHandler and com.tc.exception.MortbayMultiExceptionHelper are the relevant classes. 

An example from the wild:
