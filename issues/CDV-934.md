## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The eclipse plugin doesn't have a nice tim-get thing.  In fact, with tim-get, the fact that the eclipse plugin uses its own private installation of Terracotta is even more confusing.

We have to unify this library stuff somehow.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The 2.7 version of the DSO Eclipse plugin has a menu item "Update modules..." that is effectively: tim-get.sh install --all.

We need something more granular otherwise, it is difficult to mimic what we have on our server.
