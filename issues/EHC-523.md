## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I was playing around with the JGroups provider a while back I was able to see logging when the replication events occurred, however with RMI I am not able to see anything.  I have tried setting the logging level for net.sf.ehcache to TRACE but that did not help.  I looked at the code and noticed there was only logging for error conditions.  It would be very helpful to see logging for events such as multicast initialization, every time a message is received, etc.
