## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

on-load behavior associated with a parent is not inherited to a child class [even if the child is instrumented].

Attached is reproduce case where:
- ClassA.main() can run multiple times successfully
- ClassB.main() fails on 2nd, 3rd, etc runs w/ the following exception

[quote]
	onTCLoad() invoked on [ClassA(true)]
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: transient was not repaired for [ClassB(false)]
		at ClassA.test(ClassA.java:17)
		at ClassB.main(ClassB.java:6)
[/quote]

Workaround is to define an on-load behavior for every subclass but this does not scale too well in our setup since we allow 3rd parties to subclass our DSO's.

I didn't try it yet, but I think if you remove the include for ClassB and change the other one to ClassA+ it should do what you want (that pattern will match classA and all subtypes).

Hmm, my reproduce case was too simple. :)

ClassA+ covers ClassB, but unfortunately this won't scale if I have
ClassC extends ClassB
as ClassA+ only covers direct subclasses, not descendants that are twice removed (e.g., ClassC)

Okay, so I was wrong.  ClassA+ will cover even descendants of its child.  I was mislead by the Terracotta Eclipse plugin (re: https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/CDV-1179).

Nonetheless, it's still weird that if I specify an on-load behavior for ClassC, it will overwrite [rather than be added to] the the on-load behavior for its parent.

Can we have a new feature where on-load behavior can be specified as cumulative instead of overwrite?

Feature request on last comment.

It helps us to prioritize requests if we have real world use cases.
Can you explain yours to help us with that?
thanks

We want 3rd parties to extend our classes [which are DSO's].  They can too easily  accidentally damage the restoration of transient fields in our base classes.

For example, given:

[quote]
	@InstrumentedClass
	@HonorTransient
	public class Us {
		private transient boolean m\1f = true;

		public void restoreTransient() {
			m\1f = true;
		}
	}
[/quote]

we want 3rd parties to be able to write

[quote]
	@InstrumentedClass
	@HonorTransient
	public class Them1 extends Us {
	}

	@InstrumentedClass
	@HonorTransient
	public class Them2 extends Us {
		private transient boolean m\1f2 = true;

		public void restoreTransient() {
			super.restoreTransient();
			m\1f2 = true;
		}
	}
[/quote]

The problem above is that in the current Terracotta implementation, restoreTransient() will \1not\1 be invoked for Them1 or Them2.  The workaround is to do omit @InstrumentedClass + @HonorTransient annotations.  i.e., code as

[quote]
	public interface InheritedTcDso {
		public void restoreTransient();
	}

	public class Us {
		private transient boolean m\1f = true;

		public void restoreTransient() {
			m\1f = true;
		}
	}

	public class Them1 extends Us {
	}

	public class Them2 extends Us {
		private transient boolean m\1f2 = true;

		public void restoreTransient() {
			super.restoreTransient();
			m\1f2 = true;
		}
	}
[/quote]

and tc-config.xml as

[quote]
<application>
	<dso>
		<instrumented-classes>
			<include>
				<class-expression>InheritedTcDso+</class-expression>
				<honor-transient>true</honor-transient>
				<on-load>
					<method>onTerracottaLoad</method>
				</on-load>
			</include>
		</instrumented-classes>
	</dso>
</application>
[/quote]

This is the approach illustrated in the reproduce case for CDV-1179.

There are two problems w/ this workaround:
-	If the 3rd party includes @InstrumentedClass + @HonorTransient, the original problem (no transient restore) reappears
-	We avoid the refactor-robustness of tim-annotations
-	We need to be extra-careful mixing tim-annotations w/ our own tc-config.xml
