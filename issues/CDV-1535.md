## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/4582.page

For express it'd be nice if we can skip this code path. 

The suggested fix (on the forums) of treating "java.vendor" of "Oracle\*" as BEA doesn't seem right though. I think at some point in time the vendor string for jrockit and hotspot will both become Oracle...
