## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hello again,

i was looking over BlockingCache (rev1.2 in cvs) and i
saw the 
HashMap 'locks', which contains the Mutex objects for
locking
single entries from the backing cache.

I just wonder, when the backing cache is an LRUMap and
an old
element is falling out, why this removal isnt reflected
to the corresponding Mutex object in 'locks. 

Does this mean, 'locks' will grow forever? 

Even when no object is contained in the backing cache
anymore, 'locks' will still contain earlier created
Mutex objects?

If this is not wanted, would a simple locks.remove(key)
help, if put(key,null) has been called? Maybe not,
since threads might wait on that Mutex object, that is
being removed in put. One gets the permission to enter
after the Mutex has been removed from 'locks', because
its been released. But the thread, that entered, cant
release this Mutex object later anymore, since on a
put(key,newValue) its also a new Mutex object.

Mh. Old discussion?
