## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

running ehcachce-core-2.4.0 against a clustered Terracotta instance can bring in a dependency on ehcache-terracotta.jar. However, that class is dependent on an EhcahceXAStore that no longer exists and used to be part of ehcache-core from what I can see. 

This leaves people trying to run that version unable to work against terracotta as the applicaiton won't start up and throws 

 Invocation of init method failed; nested exception is net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: Unable to load class net.sf.ehcache.terracotta.StandaloneTerracottaClusteredInstanceFactory. Initial cause was net/sf/ehcache/transaction/xa/EhcacheXAStore

There shouldn't be any problem running ehcache-core 2.4.0 clustered with Terracotta. EhcacheXAStore is a 2.3.x internal class which was removed from 2.4.0 so if you've upgraded both your ehcache-core and terracotta-ehcache jars you shouldn't get this kind of problem.

Can you be a bit more specific about what you've done to get this result? A simple app which reproduces the problem would help a lot but at the very least, the exact versions of your ehcache-core, terracotta-ehcache and terracotta server as well as the complete stack trace you're getting as well as a brief description of what your application is doing is needed to get an idea of what could have gone wrong.

The issue was I cant find the new 2.4 compatible version for the terrcotta jars. Show me where that is and I will be happy to verify. The terracotta jar that provides the standaloneclusteredinstance isnt in maven.  I am using the 2.3.1 ehcache-terrcotta instance

If you download a nightly TC kit, it has the ehcache-core-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT and terracotta-ehcache-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT jars. Both can be found under ehcache/lib folder

http://terracotta.org/dl/oss-download-destination?bucket=tcnightly&name=terracotta-trunk-nightly-rev16971.tar.gz&file=terracotta-trunk-nightly-rev16971.tar.gz

I still think it's a problem that the ehcache jar is available in Maven, but it's dependency is not.

ehcache-terracotta is not a runtime dependency of ehcache-core and it doesn't reside on Maven central repo.

You will need to add Terracotta Maven repo url in your pom.xml to be able to pull down ehcache-terracotta
