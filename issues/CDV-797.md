## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

MultiNodeInvalidatorTest fails fairly regularly because the L1s exit with this assertion error

com.tc.object.lockmanager.api.LockNotPendingError: Attempt to reject a lock request that isn't pending: lockID: LockID(D540816D200CA69D05EEA7C8750978970808F6A9D90AA0B12625), level: 2, requesterID: ThreadID=[7], waitLocksByRequesterID: \{\}

            at com.tc.object.lockmanager.impl.ClientLockManagerImpl.cannotAwardLock(ClientLockManagerImpl.java:483)

I'm almost certain this problem has something to do with the tryLock() APIs.  TC sessions makes pretty heavy use of this API, and anyone who uses tryLock() on ReentrantLock and/or ReentrantReadWriteLock() could be affected by this bug

this is probably the same thing as CDV-649

this should be resolved with Geert's fixes for tryLock(). Test is re-enabled

The test passing should be verification enough for this...2.6.3
