## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I noticed the following log message when running a JUnit test with the latest EhCache in AppFuse.

Nov 4, 2009 1:17:40 PM net.sf.ehcache.util.UpdateChecker checkForUpdate
WARNING: Update check failed: java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 403 for URL: http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/tc/update-checker/ehcache-update-list.properties

IMO, I think the UpdateChecker should be turned off by default. Most developers know when they need to upgrade. If they don't, make it a configurable option. Opt-in is always better than opt-out.

Just FYI, we have made that WARNING message into a DEBUG message for the next release already so a failed update check isn't as visible.

There are currently two ways to turn off the update check:
- In the ehcache.xml with <ehcache updateCheck="false"> ...
- With a system property: -Dnet.sf.ehcache.skipUpdateCheck=true

We've also dialed down the warning message into a DEBUG message.
