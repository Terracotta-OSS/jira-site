## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is a wrapper bug to collect all instances where we can warn when an invalid config is detected, for example:
- a root is specified in a class that when loaded does not have the field specified
- autolocking is defined on a class that is not instrumented
- rejection of a root that is attempted to be re-assigned (but the re-assignment is silently ignored)

</div>
