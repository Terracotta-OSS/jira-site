## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

definitely a future item, but from time to time I've wished I had an asynchronous lock API available. This API would be like the regular lock methods except that it wouldn't block and would require a callback object. 

Something like this could be useful to better parallelize sesson reaping, and would be an alternative to places where one might use a thread for the sole purpose of blocking until a lock award can happen
