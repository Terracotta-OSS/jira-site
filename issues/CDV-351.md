## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I had some config that marked a certain field transient - I then removed that transient from my code.

When I attempted to execute my code, I was treated to a dialog which informed me that there were errors in the config.xml.  I would like to see a button called "Details >>" that would give me more information on what exactly is wrong with the config file.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

A ConfigProblemsDialog is now displayed, showing a list of each of the problems. Selecting the problem in the list displays the relevant config element in the ConfigEditor's XML page. There is a property to stop showing the dialog and an associated project property.
