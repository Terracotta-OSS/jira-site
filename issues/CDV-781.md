Also make sure when nodes get zapped (due to "two active servers in the network" or otherwise, the servers restart automatically.

I found some discrepancies regarding design doc versus what actually implemented:

1.  The name of the backup folder: 
           - design doc:  dirtydb-backup-<timestamp>

           - actual:   dirty-objectdb-backup
                                |------------- dirty-objectdb-080711142725

2. timestamp could be made more standard, ie. yyyyMMddHHmmSS .  I'm not sure what the format being used right now.

I think there was some comment about the backup directory. Hence changed to dirty-objectdb-<timestamp> which in my opinion better than what was described in the design doc. The design doc is not updated.

About comment 2) we can probably do something about it.

Right now the timestamp format used for directory creation is yyMMddHHmmss. Will change it to as recommended above.
