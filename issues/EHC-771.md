Based on http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/4128.page#22127
I think the patch makes sense, yet I have a hard time understanding how that relates to the EOF issue

Now it is fixed... at least wrt to the release of the readLock...
No more information about the other issue the user had. At least, should it happen again, no read lock will leak
