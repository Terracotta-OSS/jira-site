## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

to reproduce:

-install eclpse plugin 3.0.0-stable0
-try to update to eclipse 3.0.0

stable0 still shows as the later version

seems like two problems:

- the site.xml for the final build doesn't list stable\* versions 
- the version is sorted alphabetically so stable\* always comes after rev\*

The current workaround is to delete the stable version of the plugin,
Install the latest and refresh.
