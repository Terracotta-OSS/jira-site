## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, the Cache maintains both a MemoryStore and (optionally) a DiskStore.  There is no synchronization used when acting on both stores in concert.  That is mostly probably ok, but could create some weird race conditions against user threads and/or the disk spool thread.  Should consider these races more carefully and possibly document why the race is not an issue as appropriate.  It's possible that some races \1are\1 important a rw lock needs to be introduced for operations that cover both in some cases.  

Since these races have likely existed for a long time, it's probably unlikely that there are major critical issues here, so this can be a longer-range thing.
