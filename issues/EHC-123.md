## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It seems like the shutdown hook is not working properly
in all situations.

Here is a use-case when it fails:

- One distributed cache, using RMI
- Two webapps deployed on the same Tomcat instance
sharing the cache.

If the CacheManager instances are not explicitly
shutdown before stopping the Tomcat instance, an
exception is thrown (once for each webapp) and the Java
process doesn't finish.

Exception in thread "Multicast Server Thread"
java.lang.NullPointerException
 at
net.sf.ehcache.distribution.MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatSender$MulticastServerThread.createCachePeersPayload(MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatSender.java:138)
 at
net.sf.ehcache.distribution.MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatSender$MulticastServerThread.run(MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatSender.java:107)


Attached is a minimal IDEA project for reproducing this
(excluding the jar-files that didn't fit).

Using: EhCache 1.2.1, Tomcat 5.5.15, Windows XP
