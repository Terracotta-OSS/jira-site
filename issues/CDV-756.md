## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We might be able to tell that the removed object isn't going to be used and not retrieve it at all.

correct me if this isn't what you're talking about...So lets think about the remove(Object) on java.util.Map that returns an Object. If the calling code ignores the return value, we could maybe make a different invocation that would not require faulting the removed object. example:

   void foo(Map m, Object key) \{  
     m.remove(key); // return value ignored
   \}

tim pointed out that we can' do the "call another method" approach because of interfaces. We can do some sort of thread local approach (turn off retrief) or wrap the object in a don't retrieve wrapper, I like the former better.

Could we do the same thing for put? Would that improve performance?

Implementation of this requires knowledge of any locking (named or auto) that has been applied to the Map classes (I'm thinking particularly of Hashtable here) - this means we need to be able to inspect the bootjar config at runtime (and know that it is correct).  DEV-2176 and DEV-2259 are the JIRAs for these features.

Needs further discussion per Chris' comments
