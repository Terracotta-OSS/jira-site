## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The current structure of the TC config file is too rigid to make it easily maintainable over time. First of all, it should allow all the declarations within the DSO tag to be intertwined. This is needed because as a developer you want to group together all the configuration based on the part of the code that you're turning into a clustered section. You want to be able to keep the instrumented classes together with their locks their transient fields and the roots. This can then be clearly commented as one section and makes it easier afterwards to understand what was needed to cluster a certain functionality.

Additionally, it should be possible to subdivide the configuration file into multiple smaller ones. Note that this should not be the only way to group declarations together in a conceptual fashion because that makes prototyping and actual development more frustrating. Developers should be able to fine-tune the main configuration file and then afterwards extract the relevant declarations into a dedicated file.

The reason that this didn't make the 2.7.1 cut is that we are leaning towards annotations.
In next Issue review we will check in on this again.
