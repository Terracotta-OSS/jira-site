## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We added svn information to published TIMs. I think this information should be logged in the client log file if it is present. This should help anytime we need to answer the question "what TIM code am I actually running?" which comes up frequently internally during development and it is inevitable in will happen with external users as well
