## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This issue came from http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/731.page

The Windows scripts convert directory paths to 8.3 form to avoid trouble with spaces.  The command that does the conversion doesn't work with a path like C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0, but does with C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\_04.

I guess we have to go back to the old way of quoting the given paths, from 2.4.

Were we fixing another issue when we changed it for 2.5? Will we lose the original fix if we go back to 2.4 style quoting of strings?  thanks

The workaround is to install (JDK) to a path without spaces. Fiona to add to known issues

Added to Known issues in 2.5 release notes. This should be reviewed for Pacheco and a solution to the bug found

Going back to the 2.4 versions should be good.

Applied fix to WebSphere Applicaton Server scripts.

r7570:
Applied broken path fixes for all other Windows scripts.
It was also broken for other constructed paths besides, JAVA\_HOME.

NOTES:
The issue was that in Windows when JAVA\_HOME is defined, and the path contains spaces, it will already have quotes around the path,
this was screwing up our scripts when we put yet another set of quotes around it before shortening it into the 8.3 format.

We now remove the quotes from JAVA\_HOME if it is defined, and re-add it, before shortening to 8.3 format.

Tested with Terracotta trunk-nightly-rev7671, with JAVA\_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0 on windows

scripts are not working.

Steps:
1. Install the kit
2. set JAVA\_HOME="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0"
3. Navigate to C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-trunk-nightly-rev7671\bin and execute version.bat

Actual: The system cannot find the path specified.

Note: It is working fine when JAVA\_HOME is set to "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0\_04"

Reverting back to not using or converting paths to 8dot3 format. Windows facility for effecting this isn't very reliable - it may work on a certain machine, but wont on another with the same OS config. 

I've added an extra line however to remove the quotes from the incoming paths, and re-add it ourselves, which seems to be causing the issue the prompted this changeset.
The line was (and similar other lines):

   set JAVA\_HOME="%JAVA\_HOME:"=%"

Also, we now strip quotes before calling catalina scripts. This is because the catalina scripts does some Windows longpath hacking itself, and it does not expect the incoming paths to be properly quoted.

See: rev 7736, 7745, 7752 (trunk); rev 7754, 7755, 7756 (2.6)
