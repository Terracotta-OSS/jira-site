## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The "configuration bundles" project requires that parts of our system be made into pluggable modules and to enable 3rd party framework/app developers to create their own pre-packaged configurations to have Terracotta DSO cluster their app/framework.

For in-house plugins, we need to be able to do the following:

1. Compilation step needs to build the plugins after the main code, which are distinct from normal modules
    * until more work can be done, plugins will depend on dso-l1 and often thirdparty/aspectwerkz as well
    * plugin classes should NOT be added to tc.jar
    * each plugin needs to be packaged as an individual JAR file with a special plugin-specific META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
2. All tests need to be 
  a) told where the plugin JARs (or plugin classes when running from the IDE) are and 
  b) made to tell the config system which ones are needed for the test
    * This can be done per test case or in TCTestCase or some combination of both
    * This affects _all_ tests, including other frameworks like performance tests and customer tests...
    * Eugene pointed out that the tests themselves should be located in the plugin, but the above points still apply for those tests. Just might be the other way around (plugin tests need to be told where the dso core is) plus they will introduce additional dependencies on the testing frameworks
3. Distributions need to now include a top level "plugins" directory containing all of the in-house plugin JAR files
