## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

As the cluster info API currently relies entirely on the server for its data, races between committing transactions and object locality queries can lead to confusing results.  This was seen in the ClusterMetaDataActiveActiveTest where the server was reporting that objects created in transactions that are yet to be committed are reported as not being local on the originating client.

This can be solved by merging the locality information reported by the client into the server results to ensure that new objects are reported correctly.
