## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When you run the demo server and a demo client in a shell with both in the background, the following message is emitted to the console every minute:

 2008-03-27 15:08:35,884 [DSO Lock Object.wait() timer] INFO com.tc.object.lockmanager.api.ClientLockManager - ChannelID=[0]: Running Lock GC...

It interferes with normal use of the shell and isn't very useful to the end-user.  Whether or not this message should even go in the log is debatable, but no repetitive message should go to the console.

Is this important to have all the time? Or at debug level?

Are you sure it goes to the console ? It goes to the logs alright. It is useful to have it in the logs and even now we figured out an issue because of the logging.

If it goes to the console, we ill remove it. But I am pretty sure it doesnt go to the console.

This was happening because there was a .tc.dev.log4j.properties in my home directory, which alters the TC logger even if the file has no content.
