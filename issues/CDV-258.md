## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It's not actually clear what the effect of this is...

The format of the session identifier for a websphere app looks like it has three components:

1) The first 4 characters are some sort of cache ID that might have something to do with websphere's dynacache stuff
2) The real session identifier
3) a server identifier (aka cloneID) 

For the time being we are ignoring component #1 and using the "default" cacheId of "0000". This item is the reminder to get to the bottom of it. The terracotta class that generates session IDs should have a way to specify the cacheID, but there won't be any instrumentation to hook it up to a "real" value under we understand what it means and where it comes from

Antonio -- with your work on the IBM HTTP server, do you think this is still necessary?

Yes, I still think we need to understand what is the cacheID used for and how/when is it being changed.
