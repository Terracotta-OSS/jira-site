## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I've always thought it was weird that you were required to define a default cache config even when you (often) don't even need it.  It makes every config file longer and for simple examples more confusing.  This is a small usability thing but again, it's just one more little confusing road bump for a user to conquer.

Seems like an interesting thing to discuss. Greg what do you think?

Talked to greg and he agreed that making the default cache optional unless someone uses the addCacheNamed method makes sense
