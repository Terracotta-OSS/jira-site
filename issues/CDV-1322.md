## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a class like so:

public class MyVector extends Vector \{
private Vector v;

public void removeRange(int fromIndex, int toIndex) \{
super.removeRange(fromIndex, toIndex);
\}
\}

that produces java.lang.VerifyError:
(class: org/apache/ojb/broker/util/collections/RemovalAwareCollection, method: removeRange signature: (II)V) Bad access to protected data (java.lang.VerifyError) 

Terracotta 3.0.1
Linux: Centos 5 64bit, happens in Windows as well
JDK 1.6.0\_14 - 64bit

Sounds similar to CDV-162

That is a TC bug, no doubt. Do instances of that type actually need to clustered though? If not, then you can <exclude> it in your tc-config.xml to avoid the broken instrumentation we are applying to it

Look into this in 3.1.x (after Rivera).
If easy quick fix, do it. If more complex bring to DRB

I've excluded it to get up and running, but it's going to cause issues since RemovalAwareCollection is an Apache OJB class that is used in all of my domain objects, which are commonly clustered.  To work around this, I'll need to create my own collection that uses aggregation instead of inheritance and tell OJB to use that.
