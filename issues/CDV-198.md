## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

run-dgc causes distributed garbage collection iff the config has garbage collection disabled and is meant for the operation who wants more control over when dgc happens than that which is provided via the config file.
We should provide a way for the operator to force a dgc via the AdminConsole's Distribubted Garbage Collection page.
This would be very easy to do.

Tested with rev 4738, it is working as expected.

1. Navigate to /install-root folder/samples
2. modify the tc-config.xml to force the dgc

update under tc-config/servers/server/dso/garbage-collection

<dso>
     <garbage-collection>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
     </garbage-collection>
</dso>

3. execute ./start-demo-server.sh -f tc-config.xml
4. Navigate to  install-root folder/samples/pojo
5. execute ./run.sh &
6. Launch the admin Console
7. In the admin Console, select the Garbage collection and click Run GC button

Actual: 
2007-08-01 13:56:06,178 [GCRunnerThread] INFO com.tc.management.beans.object.ObjectManagementMonitor - Running GC.
 2007-08-01 13:56:06,185 [GCRunnerThread] INFO com.tc.objectserver.api.ObjectManager - Notifying GC : pending = 0 checkedOutCount = 0
