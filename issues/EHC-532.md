<div markdown="1" class="comment">

license info is set in the ehcache-moniotr.conf
Verified that the probe is getting the license from the server as expected.

Steps:

1. started the probe and trying to create cachemanager
2.  WARNING: Error connecting to the server at address '10.0.4.194' and port '9889', retrying in 30 seconds ...
3. started the monitor server with trial license 
4. Started monitor server successfully

Actual: Probe got its license info from the server
And probe registered successfully with server

</div>
