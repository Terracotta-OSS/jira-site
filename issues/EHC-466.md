## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, if you start the ehcache probe, then start the ehcache monitor server, the probe does not re-register itself with the monitor server and will not show up.  If the probe cannot connect with its designated master, it should periodically re-try the connection.  Might need some properties around that, not sure.

Actually, the retry logic is in there now, I thought you were talking about something else when we talked on IM. You can start a probe and it will retry 10 times while waiting 30 secs in between, there can be set through properties. Is something else needed?

Hmm, that's not what I saw but maybe I didn't wait long enough.  I think it should try for longer than that (maybe even forever) though but we can see what PM thinks.

It should output to the logs that it's retrying ... the actual behavior is tweakable of course, waiting for PM for this then?

I think it should retry for ever.
