## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When the server is unavailable, the client prints out a helpful message:

2008-09-11 21:19:19,847 WARN - Can't connect to server[localhost:7890]. Retrying...

however, it only prints it once - I believe it retries constantly - I think it should print this message on every connect attempt.



</div>
