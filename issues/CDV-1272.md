## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Class A has a postCreate method
Class B extends A.

If you share an instance of class B the postCreate method will not be invoked. When we look for postCreate methods we only take the top level type name into consideration. 

This is currently causing the evictor thread to not be started in nodes which initially share instances of ClusteredDistributedMap (from tim-map-evictor).
