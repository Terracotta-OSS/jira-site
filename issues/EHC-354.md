## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

SimplePageCachingFilter returns same content for GET and HEAD HTTP-methods.

This caused situations with our site, when sometimes users asks pages of site with method GET, and receives empty pages. Because some robot request this page with method HEAD before and SimplePageCachingFilter stores empty page for method HEAD to cache.

I've created the patch for this situation.

I've tested this patch and it works fine.
