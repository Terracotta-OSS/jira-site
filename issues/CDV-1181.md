title: "Since Terracotta does not recommend CMS Collector on either L2 or L1, perhaps we can detect if a L1/L2 is using CMS and print a warning to the Log."

## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Terracotta recommends the default/Parallel/Other collectors and not CMS, given instability (SigSEGVs, long GCs after the JVM is up for a while (e.g. days)) noticed in labs and reported by customers. Sun seems to concur that CMS can lead to process stability issues.

Therefore, recommend that the product spit a warning if it detects the CMS Collector in use on the L2 or the L2. 
Thanks

Check to see if its possible to deduct what collector is being used from with in the VM. 1.5 might expose some mechanism already.
