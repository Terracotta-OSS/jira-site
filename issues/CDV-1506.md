## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When the L1 client was exclusive to the whole VM it was reasonable to make System.exit() calls on unrecoverable failures and unexpected errors. With express I don't think we can make that argument -- It is maybe reasonable to stop a particular L1 but attempting to exit the VM is stepping outside of our bounds. 

This item is to clean up the code to only call System.exit() in custom mode and for express to instead just kill the originating L1. If this fix is only going into vicente then there should be no distinction for dso/custom mode.

I don't know for sure without a good deal of code reading, but the fact that there are "dead" clients out there makes me wonder whether something in them might trip a system exit.

Does this make sense to do in 2.5.x or do we have to wait for DSO removal?

I don't think this strictly dependent on DSO removal really but it seems to fit naturally with it (timeframe wise at least).

Certainly would be part of an ehcache release (is that what you meant by 2.5.x?). This is core terracotta code, nothing really to do with ehcache
