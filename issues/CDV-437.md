## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the Terracotta Eclipse plugin:

1. Select a class with a main
2. Right-click, and do "Run As Terracotta DSO Application" 
3. You are prompted with "Start a local Terracotta Server?" and a checkbox "Remember this setting".  Check the box.
4. Press the No button.  Application runs.
5. Repeat steps 1,2.  

Expect: application will run (without a local terracotta server being started)
Actual:  prompted again with the same box as in #3 - the "Remember this setting" checkbox doesn't seem to work.
