## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Based our thread in the Developers forum (see https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread\_id=3270458&forum\_id=322280 ), I added a cache configuration named "clearOnFlush" that is true by default (matching existing behavior).  When the option is set to false, the MemoryCache is not cleared when Cache.flush() is called.
