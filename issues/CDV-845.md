## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I created a brand new project, then added some classes.

Then, I configured a field as a root using the context menu at the field declaration.  The class was not added to the includes section.
Then, I configured a method as autolocked using the context menu at the method declaration.  The class was not added to the includes section.

Very confusing.

I think it does this intentionally because classes containing a root are automatically included.
