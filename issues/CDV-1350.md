## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There are types that aren't automagically portable from java.util.Collections. We support the "unmodifiable", "synchronized" and "empty" types. For some reason we never did the "singleton" ones. And from java 1.5 we don't have the "checked" versions and 1.6 we don't have the "asLifoQueue" and "newSetFromMap" types

Would be nice to clean this up - I hate having to add a caveat for stuff like this.  Obviously not critical for Rivera.

If this is easy we can make it low priority for 3.1.1
