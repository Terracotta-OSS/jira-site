## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment we store Literals (primitives, primitive wrapper types, Strings, Classes, etc) directly in the corresponding managed state objects that contain them. This isn't always a problem, but a hot object (one that stays in cache) and that contains lots of "large" literals (ie. large Strings), the memory requirements can be unacceptable. 

As a simple test, load up a single shared map with many large string values. One shouldn't be able to OOME the server in this way, but it will.
