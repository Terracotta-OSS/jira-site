Kunal I think you worked on this, and that everything is OK there now.
Can you confirm and mark resolved if this is the case?

We think this is due to the fact that OOO was configured on one end and not configured on the other.

To avoid such situation, we should get any stack configuration from the server during handshake.

I can think of 2 solutions for this.

1. We should be able to bypass a layer and its processing (here OOO) if the layer is optional based on the sender's comm stack.

2. During handshaking, the OOO should look for its parallel layer in the peer's comm stack and if it is not present drop the connection request with proper error messages.

Could be part of Big Giant config re-org.
L1 reconnect settings can cause this if different on client/server
