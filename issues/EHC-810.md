## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When the concept of store implementation specific MBeans was added to ehcache-core the signature of the ManagementService.registerMBeans(...) method was changed (A boolean was added to indicate whether or not store specific beans should be registered).  This broke backwards compatibility for people whose own classes (or classes in one of their dependencies) relied on this signature.  This was fixed by Greg Luck in rev:3076 of trunk, but the change has not yet been merged to the 2.3.x branch so that the issue is fixed in the upcoming 2.3.1 release.
