<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Could we extend this to monitor the coherency of individual clients?  Then we could see clients become coherent and then tell which clients are holding back the cluster from becoming coherent.

dev-console shows when cache becomes incoherent and coherent in configuration tab. Verified using cachetest.
