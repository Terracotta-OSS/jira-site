## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Glassfish uses a forked version of tomcat as it's servlet container. The tomcat specific portions of the DSO session code are not compatible with this fork. In particular the Valve interface and StandardPipeline implementations are different. These currently means we cannot do DSO sessions in tomcat. The changes in to interfaces in Glassfish present two problems:

1) Valves don't call on the next valve, so there is not oppurtunity to wrap the request and response objects
2) There is no way to catch and exception in the valve pipeline

We rely on both of those characteristics at the moment -- #1 so that we can intercept access to session, and #2 to perform an unlock() at the end of the request (no matter whether an exception is thrown)
