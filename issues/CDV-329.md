Tested with os kit Terracotta 2.7.0-stable0, as of 20080728-210703 (Revision 9506 by cruise@WXPMO0from 2.7), 
and ee kit Terracotta Enterprise Edition 2.7.0-nightly-rev9528, as of 20080729-230752 (Revision 2319-9528 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7),

The following modules are removed from the kit:

clustered-ehcache-1.2.4-1.0.0.jar
clustered-ehcache-1.3-1.0.0.jar
clustered-ehcache-commons-1.0-1.0.0.jar

The following modules still exists in the kit

clustered-apache-struts-1.1-1.1.0.jar (which is expected in the kit)
clustered-commons-collections-3.1-1.0.0.jar (to be removed ?)
clustered-websphere-6.1.0.7-1.0.0.jar (to be removed ?)

I believe that websphere is OK to keep in the kit, and struts until we go final.
collections I think we need.
Jason can you weigh in here?

Closing as this any additional Module work will be tracked in their own Jiras
