## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It seems to be an copy-paste error.


```
    /\1\1
     \1 Sets the default SizeOfPolicyConfiguration for this cache manager.
     \1
     \1 @param sizeOfPolicyConfiguration the SizeOfPolicy Configuration
     \1/
    public final void addSizeOfPolicy(SizeOfPolicyConfiguration sizeOfPolicyConfiguration) {
        if (transactionManagerLookupConfiguration != null) {
            throw new ObjectExistsException("The SizeOfPolicy class has already been configured");
        }
        this.sizeOfPolicyConfiguration = sizeOfPolicyConfiguration;
    }
```

Nice catch! Just curious how you ran into this?

I was testing EHC 2.5 with the sample ehcache.xml. After uncommenting the SizeOfPolicy I ran into this exception because the TransactionManagerLookup is defined at the beginning of the sample ehcache.xml.
