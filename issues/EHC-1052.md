## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi, 

My environnement :
- Ehcache 2.6.6
- Weblogic 10.3.6
- Spring 2.5

I try to insert 100000 elements in local transactionnal cache (maxEntriesLocalHeap : 200000).

When the jvm start a spring bean is instantiated which will insert 100000 elements in a cache, the process is :
	-	Create a list that contains the 100000 elements
	-	Start transaction with a timeout value about 360 seconds
	-	cache.putAll(theList) ==> During this step a TimeOutTransactionException is raised
The insertion failed.

After this first attempt, i try to relaunch the insertion :
	-	Create a list that contains the 100000 elements
	-	Start transaction with a timeout value about 360 seconds
	-	cache.putAll(theList) ==> The insertion took only 4200 seconds
	-	Commit the transaction
The insertion succeed

I don't understand why the first attempt fail after 6 minutes(Timeout value) while the second attempt took less than a minute?

Thanks in advance.

I made a mistake : it's 4200 milliseconds instead of 4200 seconds

I've managed to reduce the insertion time of the 10 000 elements by warming up the cache

The process is :
- Start the JVM
- Begin transaction(60sec timeout)
- Insert 100 elements
- Commit transaction
- Launch the big insert

When i proceed like this the massive insertion took only 8000 milliseconds !
I don't understand why a small insertion reduce the time for the second ?

Team, can you verify/validate these findings?
Is there an issue?
