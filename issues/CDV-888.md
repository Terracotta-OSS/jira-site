"There is no out of memory error in log files because I can't export stats if OOME occured on server."

I've noticed the same thing - if you take the server down there's no way to get the stats.  We should be able to get whatever stats were recorded up to the point the server died - within reason of course (anything buffered may not be available obviously)

Well, there is a way, he could just zip up his statistics directory on the server machine and send that. From there, statistics can be extracted. The other option is to have a second process running on the server machine that is independent of the actual L2.

What should we do with this? Is there a new feature to be added to allow this?
