## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

according to the open source download page on the terracotta web site, you can checkout the open source edition via anonymous svn:

Source Repository

Terracotta source code is available for anonymous checkout via SVN.


However when I click the link, it asks for my login, then says access denied. Going directly to Fisheye shows no projects either.

I assume you're talking about this page?

http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/devdocs/Source+Repository

Someone will need to look into if/why fisheye isn't visible. I can see things but I suspect my login is associated with other groups 

The svn checkout URLs listed on that page though should work fine for anonymous access (eg. "svn checkout http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/tc/dso/trunk terracotta")

I tried fisheye with a "regular" login that should have no special privileges. I can see sources although it wasn't obvious where they were. I had to click Sources->All Repositories (http://svn.terracotta.org/fisheye/browse and http://svn.terracotta.org/fisheye/browse/Terracotta/)

Gives me an access denied page, I have a regular user account 'ryanv'. I can see via fisheye now, however I got 403 forbidden on direct anonymous svn access.

http://svn.terracotta.org/svn

(403 forbidden). 

I can access http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/tc or http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/quartz, so maybe that is by design to set up a svn root for each project?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Yeah I think the individual svn root is the explanation why the parent URL doesn't work. That is confusing but I think likely not change. 

I'll pass along the access denied problem getting to the confluence page. I get the same thing with my "regular" user too

Fiona do you know who would know what is wrong with the permissions for this page? 

http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/devdocs/Source+Repository

It is linked from the open source download page here:

http://terracotta.org/downloads/open-source/catalog

The same is true I think for all the confluence links there.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

There are two issues

one is an account creation issue, with users not getting the group set as "confluence users"
Its been a problem for over a year now.

the second is that the devdocs space was removed from public a long time ago. I have no idea why it is still linked. Passing the buck to web folks in Marketing

### **Fiona OShea** <span class="date">2012-07-03</span>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

These pages are no longer public as the content was out of date. We are updating the download page to remove the incorrect links.
