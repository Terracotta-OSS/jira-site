## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

refer to forum thread http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/815.page#4867

Look like session invalidation thread does not have some context set inside tomcat, because of which  it does not have java component naming space set (java:/comp). The same code works fine in jboss 4.0.4.
