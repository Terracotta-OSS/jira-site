## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, the Terracotta L1 that is started up for an Ehcache CacheManager will attempt to manage memory but it probably doesn't actually control much of it and what it does control is already being managed by the underlying DistributedCache.  Thus, it makes sense at least in this mode to turn off the L1 memory manager in Ehcache express install.

My only hesitation would be whether this could cause OOMEs from Ehcache memory size.  That wouldn't actually be any different than non-Terracotta Ehcache but that's one of the marketable advantages of Ehcache with Terracotta - automatic memory management such that you don't have to calculate memory footprint.

I like the OOME protection for what it's worth

Me too.

Plus there is already a tc.property to disable memory manager anyways.

l1.cachemanager.enabled = false
