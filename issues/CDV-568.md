## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

maybe it's just me, but I would appreciate a way to turn off the little yellow thingies in the right margin of the source editor. It's fine to leave them on by default, but they are too close to the standard warning adornment in that area and it annoys me.

Tim, any of those annotations can be configured and/or disabled from the Window / Preferences... / General / Editors / Text Editors / Annotations preference page.

I see the preferences you're describing, but toggling the DSO ones don't seem to make the adornments go away. Maybe I'm doing it wrong, I'll talk to gary about it.

After talking to Gary let us know if this is a bug or not (or still a feature request)
