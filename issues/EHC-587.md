## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

As we are developing the new merged hibernate/terracotta second level cache provider please update the hibernate.apt doc to reflect the new reality. i.e. 3.3 api support, usage, instructions for configuring the provider in hibernate, new features and/or supported methods etc. Also useful to add a picture/reference to the dev console.
