## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I ran the jcs lab project, and it had the following output:

[INFO] Resolving bundle: org.terracotta.modules:excludes\_config:2.5.0
[INFO] Resolving bundle: org.terracotta.modules:modules-common:2.5.0
[INFO] Resolving bundle: org.terracotta.modules:guimodels\_config:2.5.0

[INFO] Resolving location: org.terracotta.modules:tim-hashtable:2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
[INFO] Resolving bundle: org.terracotta.modules:modules-common:2.6.0.SNAPSHOT

The bootjar creation phase is completely failing for this project, though I suspect that may have something to do with the 2.6.0.SNAPSHOT dependency.
