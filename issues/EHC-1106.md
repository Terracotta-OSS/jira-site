## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The project Ehcache will put the sizof-agent.jar in temporary path of operating system after the java process is launched. The cron job of operating system will clean the files which have not been accessed for a certain period of time in temporary periodically. But I found some jars of Ehcache which belong to some java processes were deleted by cron job, while some jars of Ehcache which belong to other java processes still exist in temporary directory. If the jar was deleted, the web container will restart. So I want to know  when does jvm access the the jar file of sizeof-agent.jar in classpath. Why some of jars of size-agent.jar were not deleted.  Why does ehcache put sizeof-agent.jar in temporary directory of operating system.
