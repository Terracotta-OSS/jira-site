## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I have working JMX authentication for dev and ops consoles set up in my tc-config file as such:

<authentication>
<mode>
<password-file>/usr/local/terracotta/jmxremote.password</password-file>
</mode>
<access-file>/usr/local/terracotta/jmxremote.access</access-file>
</authentication>  

I am unable to view the platform statistic recorder via the GUI or REST interfaces.

Stats recorder security is set up as:

  <http-authentication>
        <user-realm-file>/usr/local/terracotta/realm.properties</user-realm-file>
       </http-authentication>

Each piece works independently of the other. When i have JMX auth on and attempt HTTP auth i get the attached stack trace.

My forum post relating to the issue is at: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/4243.page

I searched jira as best i could for similar issues but haven't found it yet.

It's not a show stopper but it would help to have :-)
