## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

REST methods can now only target a specific probe by address and probe, a name makes it easy to target the same cache manager when the address and port might change.

Have to think about name clashes.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Introduced optional 'probename' parameter. This will work together with 'address' and 'port' to find the first probe that matches. This allows probes with the same name to still be differentiated.
