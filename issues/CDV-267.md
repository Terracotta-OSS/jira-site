## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently synchronous write locks are synchronous to disk on the server. Instead, it can be synchronous until
server receive. It would be a double failure for both the client sending the tx and server receiving the tx to
go down at the same time. This would help performance.

This is more complex than we initially thought and as per the last meeting we had, we are not going to do this until someone asks for this feature.

This was done in 3.2.1 and performance improved significantly for synchronous writes
