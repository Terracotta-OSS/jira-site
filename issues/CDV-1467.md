## Description

I'm not entirely sure when this method was added to the Valve interface, but it is present in the latest tomcat 6.0.x version. As such you'll get an AbstractMethodError if you're using our valve and using comet. 

If nothing else we should change the project to compile against a modern version of this interface and make event() throw UnsupportedOperationException.
