tim-get tool was eagerly loading the index, an if it's the first time the user has used it - then it will attempt to connect to our server --- but if the user is behind a firewall and requires a proxy, then tim-get will be unable to start, no matter what command is called.

This is resolved in trunk: it will now retrieve the index on an as needed basis.

Please also put the fix in 2.7

Now, the index is read only when the command needs it (list, info, update, install - but not help)
The fix is in trunk and 2.7
