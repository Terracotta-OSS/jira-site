<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I'm wrong.  -o foo should create a bootjar named foo if foo isn't a directory, else it creates the appropriately named file in foo.
This all came about because lib/dso-boot is no longer created in the kit in trunk and the Session Configurator was invoking make-boot-jar as above.
Fix is to change the configurator script to ensure lib/dso-boot exists.
