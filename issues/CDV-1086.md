## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If someone deliberately "unwraps" the servlet request passed to their filter/servlet/jsp and calls getSession() on the unwrapped request, you can interact with the container's native session manager and bypass terracotta. Worse yet is the container will drop a session cookie that overwrites the TC one

This only affects containers that use a servlet filter for TC session integration (ie. anything that is not tomcat based, so I think this means weblogic, webshpere and some versions of the jetty integration)
