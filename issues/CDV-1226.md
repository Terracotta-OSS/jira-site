## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In general almost all caching/clustering will require some sort of permanent storage, so it make sense to enable it globally. There are few cases where certain roots should not be written to disk or persisted between server restarts. Currently It is impossible to combine these scenarios.

e.g. Hibernate L2 caching (perm storage) + crypto keys (inmem storage)

As for the scenario where a root is declared more than once, few implementations are possible:

- use last declared storage configuration (display a warning).
- use first declared storage configuration (display a warning).
- throw an fatal error and stop if more than one storage configuration is used.

Thanks,
Pierre
