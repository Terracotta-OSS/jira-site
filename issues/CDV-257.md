## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Like most other containers there is an apache plugin available that can do sticky request routing. These plugins are always specific to the containers own specific JSESSIONID cookie formats. 

Under websphere we should build a cookie value that looks like the native websphere format. I don't know much about it, but I know it's default delimiter is ":"  (colon). To test. we'd need to setup a cluster of at least two WAS nodes, and configure an apache httpd with the websphere plugin. If the plugin is able to keep sessions sticky, I think we are in the clear

We need to download the IBM HTTP server (apache httpd + IBM mods) and set up two nodes running clustered WebSphere to try this out.

I have created 2 WAS nodes and setup sticky sessions. The requests of first sessions goes to first WAS and the requests of the second sessions goes to second WAS. When one of the WAS nodes as shut down, the session still exists and subsequent requests got route to the remaining WAS.

So, the sticky session seems working fine.
