## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When the TCNature is added to an Eclipse project, the config that is created includes a server element that has host="%i."  That pattern is getting overwritten with concrete values as of change 7992 made on 4/7/08.

The workaround is to not use patterns but rather specify host="locahost" or host="127.0.0.1."

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.1-nightly, as of 20081030-161010 (Revision 10718 by cruise@su10mo5 from 2.7), the server host="i%" pattern is not overwritten as expected when tc-config.xml is saved.

Steps:
1. Install the eclipse plugin
2. Create the jtable demo project
3. Add the Terracotta nature
4. Open the tc-config.xml with show config editor menu
5.  server host="i%" element is included
6. save the t c-config.xml 

Actual: the server host="i%" pattern is not overwritten (working as expected)
