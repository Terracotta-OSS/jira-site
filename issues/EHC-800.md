## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We are making it too much work to create extractors. 

Why don't we support JavaBeans conventions so that 

<searchAttribute name="age"/>

implies

<searchAttribute name="age" expression="value.getAge()"/>

if a getter exists on the value or the key 

If it cannot be resolved due to ambiguity ie there is an age on both key and age we throw an exception.

This might be too contrived to consider, but one place this maybe gets sticky is if during the context of one put() the key happens to have this bean property, and in a different put() the value() has it. Maybe you get what you deserve in that scenario, but it does feel a little odd to source the attribute from different context objects automatically in this case.

It might worth considering in conjunction with this a mode where all bean properties present become attributes.
