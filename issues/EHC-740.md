## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator line 320 (in 2.0.0) searching for the string "Read time out", where I'm seeing the message containing "Read timed out".
Not sure if some JVM's have different text or if this was a typo.

"timed" definitely appears. It must have been an earlier JVM. Easiest thing is to add support for both which is what I did. Ideally we could use the cause. Must be a reason, which I cannot recall right now why I am checking the string.
