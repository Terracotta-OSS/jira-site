## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The properties that are commented out in the "tc.properties" file in tc.jar cannot be overriden with a corresponding -Dcom.tc.XXX system property. The problem is that the code (that I added) in TCPropertiesImpl that applies the overrides only does so for the set of keys defined in tc.properties. 

An example of something that should work is "-Dcom.tc.session.serverid=myID", but that is ignored since "session.serverid" is commented out in the default tc.properties. 

Perhaps system properties should always be consulted when looking up a TC property value
