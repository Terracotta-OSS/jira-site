## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

EHCacheWrapper.getKeys() throws a NoClassDefFoundError for TimeExpiryMap$KeySetWrapper since we do not export the class from tc.jar to the config module. Anotinio has fixed this for now but I am not sure in which branch.

I think this might be a dup. I recall someone fixing this in trunk. Can we verify?
