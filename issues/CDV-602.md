## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Today I can add a Terracotta Nature to a Scala project but I cannot use the config editor with scala classes.
This would not be a show stopper if I could edit everything in the xml file.
Unfortunately, I cannot reference any scala filed as root (perhaps some other restriction exist).
I cannot also add parameters on the command line in order to use the work around Jonas mentionned in its tutorial:
http://jonasboner.com/2008/01/25/clustering-scala-actors-with-terracotta/

btw I think integrating Terracotta in a Scala environment would be beneficial for both technologies..
Scala already has a good abstraction with its actor model and Terracotta integration would provide a server development solution closer to the ideal.

Have you looked at adding roots programatically using the managerUtil class?

Something sad happened to me while trying this..

When I add this line to a scala program in order to take this approach:

import com.tc.object.bytecode.\_

It complains because object is a reserved scala word..; this is too bad.. :(
Is there another way I can get this feature working?

Stephane.

P.S.: I start to think I am doing the exact same path as Jonas; but the difference is that I am noob at Terracotta and the JVM environment; I hope this statement will be false soon enought..
