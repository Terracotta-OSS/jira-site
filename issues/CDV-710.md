## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is a fix to help prevent what happened here:  	 DEV-1476

One start an L2 using the "-n" parameter to select a named server (such as "server1" in the example snippet below). 

  <server host="10.0.31.20" name="server1">

The "host" portion there should be checked to actually be a local address on that machine. 

The code to do this kind of check is already present com.tc.net.AddressChecker.
