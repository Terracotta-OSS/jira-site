## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Turns out that when we did subtype matching we did 99 percent of the work to get annotations working such that someone can specify an annotation to match on instead of a pattern. Fill in the last one percent.

I've added tests for functionality in description. So, I think it is.
Though I need to add some tests for matching methods for DMI, but they probably should go under separate issue.

Annotations for class includes, method locks and dmi should work in trunk now. Added tests for dso and config loader.
