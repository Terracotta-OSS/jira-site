## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Just used tim-get.sh for the first time.  It's a very nice tool as is, but I have some suggested improvements for it:

- tim-get.sh improvements:
  - commands should take a config file and spit out the info of everything
    specified in the modules section in that file.  
  - should have an option to install everything found in that config file.
  - the tim browser (list) should give you the option of installing that tim
    into a particular config file (e.g., you point it at a config file and tell
    it to modify the config file in the right way in order to make the tim used
    in that config).
