## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

excerpt from Chris' email:

Whats happening is the get method in the cache  
gets the Element from the store under a read lock, then when it finds  
it has expired it attempts to remove it (under a write lock).  Since  
the BlockingCache now uses the same locks as the underlying store this  
means when BlockingCache calls get on a cache with non eternal  
elements, it ends up trying to do a lock upgrade since it holds the  
read lock for the whole operation so it is still held when we try and  
remove the expired element.

For ehcache-web this is a going to be a non-issue since Hung is moving  
to using the new putIfAbsent method on the cache.

Try to come up with a fix that is only in BlockingCache so that the fix is backwards compatible
