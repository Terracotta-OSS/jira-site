## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">



1. protected static final int TOO\1LARGE\1TO\1EFFICIENTLY\1ITERATE = 100; This needs to go and we always sample. I had a report from someone with a cache size of 50 which hogged CPU. This field used to be 5000. Now I believe we should just remove it.
