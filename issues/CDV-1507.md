## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment there is no good way to handle errors trying to instantiate an express L1 client. The call can block trying to resolve config URL(s) as well as establishing connections to the L2(s). There appears to be no way to influence the timeout for resolving URL config and the only way to control the server connect is with a tc.property. Although even with adjusting the server connect you end up with a System.exit() instead of an exception (ugh)
