## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

ConcurrentHashMap$HashIterator, ConcurrentHashMap$Segment, RegularEnumSet$EnumSetIterator, CyclicBarrier, Collections$UnmodifiableList$1, java.awt.Rectangle all contains calls to ManagerUtil.isPhysicallyInstrumented. 

My guess is that is happening because the regular DSO class instrumentation is trying to protect against NoSuchMethodErrors around field access in other classes. For these classes in the boot jar, I would think the field access doesn't need to be paranoid. 

We have a report of this method showing up in profiling of ConcurrentHashMap

Tim, is this something you have already addressed in all the CHM and HashMap changes that you have done over the last months?

Yeah, I did clean some of this stuff up recently, but it is yet to be checked in. I'll take this ticket
