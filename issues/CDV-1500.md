## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/reply/0/4048.page

The client statistics location element was removed from the tc-config XML Schema in 3.3 but the Eclipse Plugin wasn't updated.

Work-around: don't try to use the DSO Configuration Editor panel

Fix: simply remove anything related to client statistics location

There are more problems than the one I describe above. Some elements of our Schema have changed types.

Given that nothing can be done in 30 minutes, should we pull the plug-in, replace the current broken with the last working version, or just leave a broken one out there?

Verified with Terracotta 3.4.0, as of 20101104-141154 (Revision 16614 by cruise@su10mo4 from 3.4), the Eclipse plugin is working as expected:

Can add the terracotta nature
Can Update Itegration Modules
Can view the Configuration Editor with following tabs Tc-config.xml, DSO config, Servers config and ClientsConfig

tc-config.xml has statistics element added as expected.

Can start the Terracotta server
Can launch the TDC
