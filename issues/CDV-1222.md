## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The implementation of signal() in com.tcclient.util.concurrent.locks.ConditionObject causes multiple threads to be signaled, instead of just one as required. Run the attached java program under normal java and you'll see

% java -version
java version "1.6.0\_04"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_04-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 10.0-b19, mixed mode)

% java -cp . TestTCLock
Sending signal
  T0 got signal
Sending signal
  T1 got signal
Sending signal
  T2 got signal
Sending signal
  T3 got signal
[etc]

but run it under Terracotta and you'll see:
