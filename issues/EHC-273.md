## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We're trying to put some non-serializable objects in
the cache.
This should be made possible:
\* For inmemory caches, it must work (for example
caching a SoftReference)
\* Overflow / distributed can log a warning 
"not serializable" and return null
\* Serializable is a flag-interface, and should not be
used the way it is...
