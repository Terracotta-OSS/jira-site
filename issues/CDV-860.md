## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I should be able to specify commons collections as a dependency and our repo and it should download, but I am getting an error:

[INFO] Preparing tc:manifest

I might not know how things are supposed to work, but I'm confused by two things. First I don't think is a TIM called tim-collections. There is container type project called tim-collections that has bunch of TIMs within it (tim-hashtable, tim-sycnrhonizedset, etc). The other thing that is confusing is that I wasn't under the impression that tim-collections has any thing to do with apache commons collections. There is a clustered-commons-collections TIM that comes with the core kit (although it very incomplete)

Tim, you are 100% correct.  At the moment, clustered-commons-collections is still in the kit, not on the forge.
