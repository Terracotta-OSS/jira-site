## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Some of our production machines that will be peers in
the distributed cache are in different subnets.  In
order for the multicast discovery to work accross
subnets the time-to-live must be set higher on the
sender socket.

I created a configuration option for
cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory called
multicastPacketTimeToLive that sets the TTL on the
sender socket.
