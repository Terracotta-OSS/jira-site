## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Our application uses Java 5 syntax in JSPs and is hitting problems when running with Terracotta but works normally. For example this code:

HashMap<String,Long> times = (HashMap<String,Long>)request.getAttribute("timings");

long totalTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - times.remove("total time");

Results in a compiler error:

An error occurred at line: 35 in the jsp file: /footer.jsp
Generated servlet error:
The operator - is undefined for the argument type(s) long, Object

If I load a JSP on Tomcat without TC, then restart with TC it works fine, i.e., the bug is solely when compiling the JSP. Eugene believes that the TC bootjar has lost the generic parameter information javac needs so it doesn't know that times.remove is a Long - it has only the raw type so it thinks it's an Object.

Work-around options (to be tested):
\* plug in ant to compile JSPs forking javac and set the bootstrap path to the uninstrumented classes
\* precompile JSPs

It seems like javac see HashMap class from the bootjar that we put in there after renaming from HashMapTC. 

Because HashMapTC is compiled with 1.4 it don't have generics signatures and as a result javac can't do type inference and unbox to long value (it thinks that collection has raw Object types). So, we need to put "signature" values for all methods that HashMapTC overwrite from the original HashMap class. We can hardcode those values in the bootjar tool, or maybe less preferable - maintain separate version of HashMapTC for Java 5.

To clarify, this particular error don't really have much todo with jsp compilation. One would hit into it when running javac compiler anywhere with dso bootjar.

Is this something difficult to fix? Should we have antonio jump on it or is this something you can do?

I'll fix this. It should be reasonable trivial.
