## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/493.page

The code in question doesn't even need a valid hostname or IP addreess, it is only the DSO message channel that matters for the communication. 

I'm going to change the code just pass the IP address of the channel, but in reality you could pass a completely garbage string to JMXServiceURL here
