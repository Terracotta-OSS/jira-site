## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Invoking dso-java with a -Dtc.config=some.xml does not use the provided config (some.xml) if there is a tc-config.xml file present in the current working directory.

Need to rename the default tc-config.xml to something else to make dso-java pick up the config xml provided in -Dtc.config

I think the problem is that when dso-java.[sh|bat] goes to run the boot jar stuff, that script isn't getting the -Dtc.config that was passed to dso-java. 

the correct tc.config is used when the program finally launches, but the boot jar scripts aren't using the user supplied value for tc.config it seems
