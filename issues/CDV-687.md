## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

while choosing to add modules from eclipse plugin, the modules name has "dash", but in tc-config.xml, the names uses "underscore". Same thing is true for "-SNAPSHOT"  and ".SNAPSHOT"

See screenshots for details. From the screen shot you have:

"clustered-hibernate-3.1.2"  version "2.5.2-SNAPSHOT"

After you added it, in tc-config.xml, you have this:

<module group-id="org.terracotta.modules" name="clustered\_hibernate\_3.1.2" version="2.5.2.SNAPSHOT"/>

</div>

TC Eclipse plugin will no longer attempt to normalize the derived module name for the selected TIM jar file; eg: if the jar file is named baz-tim-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
then it will now generate the ff config entry: <module name="baz-tim" version="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT" group-id="..."/> instead of: <module name="baz\_tim" version="1.0.0.SNAPSHOT" group-id="..."/>

Re-opening, the fix for this issue needs to be recreated in the 2.5 line.

I think this is a dup (as well as being fixed) but can you verify that it is fixed?
thanks
