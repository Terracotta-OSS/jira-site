## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Please add OSGi headers to the MANIFEST.MF. 

From the source (http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/ehcache/trunk/core/pom.xml) I see that you've attempted to use the maven-bundle-plugin [which is commented out]. I'm not aware of the reasons why it didn't make it into the current versions, but if you didn't find it flexible enough, you may want to try Bundlor (http://www.springsource.org/bundlor). To make this easier, I've attached a template.mf that can be used by maven to generate an OSGi-ready MANIFEST.

Thank you.

Tim can you take a look at this sometime this week, and comment with your thoughts on this issue.

should we have OSGI headers?

Greg, do you have any idea really what users want with OSGi headers in ehcache-core? I know a little bit about OSGi but I don't really know what we should be providing.

I certainly don't want to just blindly put something in without understanding it and having tests for it.

The reason for the umming and ahhing on this it that we need a test case or a usage scenario for OSGI so that we know it is correct. A test with an OSGi container such as Equinox. We don't currently use OSGi ourselves so it makes it  hard to see if doing this is having an effect.

Can you attach a patch which adds the bundling and then maybe something we can run which shows us it is working as expected?

I'm mostly reiterating one of the things Greg just asked for, but I am curious what the addition of the OSGi stuff adds for you. Would ehcache-core then become a standalone bundle in your container that others would just depend on? Is one (perhaps unpalatable) alternative to include ehcache jar in each bundle that needs it?

Revision 4715 in ehcache-core added basic support for OSGi but wasn't complete for ehcache-core-ee. Need to figure out how to get pax-exam working for EE. Also by the time this gets picked up again hopefully there will be a version of maven-bundle-plugin that works with jdk15 (so the maven profiles that select on JDK can be removed)

I attached 2 files :
\* a patch on the ehcache-core module, changing the packaging to a pom and adding the maven-bundle-plugin configuration, so that each time you build it, the correct manifest instructions will be added
Note : we could keep the packaging as jar, according to the doc : http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html

\*a zip file, to unzip in your ehcache directory (next to the the core module), then cd into ehcache-core-osgi-modules and run the command :
mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true  clean install org.ops4j:maven-pax-plugin:run -Dframework=felix
It will build all the modules, and run a felix osgi runtime, where ehcache-core-example-osgi-consumer will interact with the OSGi'fied Ehcache
This example demonstrates the use of ehcache inside of an OSGi runtime

I would want to use the API directly for an application-level, non-distributed, etc, cache.
