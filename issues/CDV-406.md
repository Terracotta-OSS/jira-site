## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The shutown sequence in the client is half baked. Everything from ManagerImpl.stop() down needs to re-evaluted to make sure things are shutdown in a sane order, don't hang, and race conditions with container initiated stop()'s and DSO shutdown hooks are eliminated.
