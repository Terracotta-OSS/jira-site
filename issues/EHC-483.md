<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Since I don't have/know the font from the Ehcache logo, I can't really append Console to it while making it look credible

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Verified with EhcacheDX beta version, the  "Ehcache Conosle a product from Terracotta" logo appears in the ehcache monitor as expected.
