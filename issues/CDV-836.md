## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

After running for under 24 hours our server freezes up.  And it looks like all 400 tomcat threads are tied up waiting for their sessions.

Assuming that you guys don't have a minor race condition in your session code, then maybe it's a communication error? how could someone trouble shoot that?

We are also accessing the sessions pretty much on every single request coming to the server, including resources ( images/css/js, etc ), maybe the TC can't handle the shear load of requests??

Here is the client log associated with that server (www3)

Interesting how the session invalidator stopped running after the client hung.

Thank you for suggesting to get all logs from all clients.. this looks good.  Here is the log of www4, which was the second client running at the moment.

complaining about the flushing of a lock taking way too long.. and started just around the time that www3 was hung.

Here is the logfile for the TC server.  Nothing much interesting, except around the time of the hangup there was this line, from an ehcache instance:

2008-08-07 19:42:22,375 [WorkerThread(managed\_object\_fault\_stage,3)] WARN com.tc.objectserver.api.ObjectManager - Request for non-exisitent object : ObjectID=[707083] context = ObjectManagerLookupContext : [ processed count = 1, responseContext = ManagedObjectRequestContext@1071879504 [ ClientID[0] , ObjectRequestID=[170152] , [ObjectID=[707083]], requestingThread = CacheInvalidator - tc-lockCache invalidation thread0 ]] 


not sure if that is cause or effect..

I am going to attach more logs, for another time that the servers hung (i am guessing for sessions).  Here are the notes about the second incident:

-- different application, different terracotta server, different tomcat servers :)
   tc-server: msupply2
   tomcat severs: www7, www8, www9
   time-of-incident: last night
   it looks like www7 or www8 hung up, and our ops reaction was to restart them without TC (since we know we're having TC issues).
    but we forgot to deal with www9, and it seems like it is behaving just fine, weird.  The only indicator in the client-logs was that the
    session invalidator stops working.
   I know that these servers didn't print out a thread dump, but I'll see if I can find something interesting in their logs to put up here as well,
    else we'll have to do with the tc-client-logs.

thank you!

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

by the way, www9 doesn't through running the same code as www7/www8 it serves a smaller population of our users, so it doesn't use sessions quite as much, that could be why it never hung last night and was able to recover.

www7 app-logs last night

it hung at 12:08 or so (less than 10 minutes after www8 hung), it never recovered, we restarted it without TC.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The majority of threads are blocking trying to get an exclusive lock on some session. We can't tell from the thread dumps, but I suspect they are trying to get the same lock. Is this real load or simulated load? If simulated, how many sessions are ther?

There are two threads ("http-8086-Processor66" and "http-8086-Processor51") in catalina.out.080807213852-dump that looks different from the rest. They appear to be blocked in terracotta locks inside ehcache. 

I'll have to look into the 2.5.2 code, but those "Request for non-exisitent object" errors on the terracotta server could very well be relevant here. My theory (still needs investigation) is that the missing objects cause locks to be held in thread ""CacheInvalidator - tc-lockCache invalidation thread0" since it never finishes it's lookup. 

If the two tomcat threads that are blocked in ehcache have also taken session locks, I can believe more requests on those sessions will just hang forever. The session lock is taken when request.getSession() is called and is held for the duration of the request.

p.s. If there are more nodes in the cluster, getting thread dumps of ALL of them at the time things are hung would be good.

### **Fernando Padilla** <span class="date">2008-08-13</span>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

This is real load.

So you're saying that ehcache is really the one blocking causing a request to block for ever;
Secondarily tc-sessions can only deal with a single request accessing the session at a time, thus all future requests to that session are blocked, and thus exhausting our tomcat threads?  Hmm, thank you for shedding some light.

This is real load, and I did give up all the logs I had for the 2 incidences ( one with 2 clients and one with 3 clients ).

It sounds like 2.6.2 has done lots of work around locks and stuff, I'll try upgrading to that again and see how things behave then.

Hi Tim, I'm having just about the same issue with 2.6.2 while attempting to load test and deploy the Terracotta implementation for Ziff. If this is something your working on right now? I'm more than happy to provide you with whatever you need to replicate and resolve it. I'd even be willing to bring my entire tc-sessions code-base on site (notebook) if need be. Everything is tested and ready to go at this point. Things are just freezing up during load testing.

This is basically what I'm working on right now. I'll be gathering debug output and general information surrounding the problem.

Thanks,

Just another quick note: the exact same code-base is currently running in out production environment without Terracotta clustered sessions. And running the load test against our dev servers w/o Terracotta runs with approx 15 requests per second and doesn't freeze. The only variable is Terracotta Sessions. CPU is almost nothing and memory usage is low (my first suspicion).

I hope you can track this down :), because we have given up on TC-sessions until this is fixed.

We are currently seeing locks up when clients are starting up, while other clients are up and doing work.  So we can never restart servers during the day, just turn them off and wait until off hours.. :( :( :(

And this is after we turned of TC-Sessions, TC-Ehcache, and Spring Integration.  So.. I hope that a version of TC higher than 2.5.2 will fix this.. I hope that we can upgrade soon and not run into any issues..

I'm still looking into things but at this point the finger seems to be pointing at my attempt to cluster ACEGI security. Terracotta has had ACEGI support on their todo list for about 2 years now and given these two message threads it appears to have some serious implementation issues. I really need to discuss it's importance with my client (though I know the answer is going to be "Terracotta said: no code changes").

Yep, case closed for me. With ACEGI disabled my load test is cruising at break neck speeds. I'll be upgrading to the new Spring native security/authentication mechanism.
