## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Add to ehcache statistics capture and flow through to monitor, JMX and Terracotta dev console aggregated statistics since last removeAll. This would require aggregate since JVM start to be retained and new fields created. An alternative to this is to implement history. 



User comment:

5) I would like to see a next metrics to make overall picture more clear for me to analyze and change my cache configuration properly: time passed from last time the specific cache region was outdated(cleared), total number of successful/unsuccessful cache hits to specific cache region since last time this cache region was outdated(cleared), number of times cache region was outdated, average time of life, etc. Also it would be very useful to have possibility to configure/filter metrics/cache regions displayed on WebUI page.
