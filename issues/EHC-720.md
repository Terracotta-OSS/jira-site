## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

LFU and FIFO eviction algorithms are probabilistic in nature. Is there a way (cache configuration etc.) to make them deterministic. 

For LRU, system argument Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru can be used to get deterministic behavior. I want to check if similar thing exists for LFU and FIFO algorithms.
