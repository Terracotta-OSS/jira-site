## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi, i'm using terracotta 3.5, with toolkit terracotta-toolkit-1.2-runtime-3.0.0.jar. 
From a client, i get a reference to a distribuited BlockingQueue, where i put some informations that another client uses. 

If the net goes down, or if the application thinks that is no more aligned, i need to do a "shutdown" of TerracottaClient and then a new connection. 

The problem is that this lead to a memory leak, and after 3/4 reconnection i get PermGen OutOfMemory error.
All threads and classes are not terminated or released after the call to shutdown method of TerracottaClient.

Can you please provide a reproducible test case?
Can you provide JVM, Environment information?

thanks

Hi, i forgot a "small" thing: the client terracotta is inside an applet (it's for intranet use only).
I tried to shutdown from a standard client, and it stops cleanly.
But if i take the same code and i launch it from an applet, after shutdown che classes aren't collected (unloaded) and after 5/6 reconnection applet crash. Sometimes java can collect, but once every 5/6 reconnections.
To make terracotta works inside the applet, i've signed the applet, and also setted the SecurityManager to a custom one (that always permits) before connecting to server.

Using java 6.24, firefox 4.01.

To test, i simply call several times this snippet:

////////////////////////////////////////////
try \{
	Thread.sleep(3000);
\} catch (Exception e) \{
	
\}

try \{
				//
	client =  new TerracottaClient("10.1.0.34:9510", true);
	System.out.println("Connected");
	client\_shutdowned = false;
	
	nodeId = client.getToolkit().getClusterInfo().getCurrentNode().getId();
	
	cl = new ClusterListener() \{
	
		
		@Override
		public void operationsEnabled(ClusterEvent arg0) \{
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			
		\}
		
		@Override
		public void operationsDisabled(ClusterEvent arg0) \{
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			
		\}
		
		@Override
		public void nodeLeft(ClusterEvent arg0) \{
			System.out.println("Node disconnected from Terracotta Cluster.");
			Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() \{
				public void run() \{
					try \{
						Thread.sleep(1000);
					\} catch (InterruptedException e) \{
						e.printStackTrace();
					\}
					queue = null;
					cl = null;
					nodeId = null;
					client.shutdown();
					client\_shutdowned = true;
					System.out.println("Disconnected automatically");		
				\}
			\});
			t.start();
			
		\}
		
		@Override
		public void nodeJoined(ClusterEvent arg0) \{
			// TODO Auto-generated method stub
			
		\}
	\};
	
	client.getToolkit().getClusterInfo().addClusterListener(cl);
	queue = null;
	
	queue = client.getToolkit().getBlockingQueue("queue/A");
	
	
	try \{
		Thread.sleep(60000);
	\} catch (InterruptedException e) \{
		e.printStackTrace();
	\}
	
	if (!client\_shutdowned)				
	\{
		client.getToolkit().getClusterInfo().removeClusterListener(cl);
		queue = null;
		cl = null;
		nodeId = null;
		client.shutdown();				
		System.out.println("Disconnected manually");
	\}
\} catch (Exception e1) \{
	
	e1.printStackTrace();
\}
