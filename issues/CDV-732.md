## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Doing:

$ ssh -L9520:localhost:9520 bastion.terracottatech.com
$ ssh -L9520:localhost:9520 gbevin@su10qa2

allows a local admin console to talk to 9520 on the local machine with everything before tunneled over ssh to the actual machine that has the L2.

However, it seems that the console insists on connecting to the IP address that the L2 actually runs on, for instance 10.0.4.6. This causes a lot of the functionality to be unavailable since it can't connect. Maybe the console should use the hostname that is used to create the actual initial connection instead of getting the ip address of the running L2 and trying to connect to that.

</div>
