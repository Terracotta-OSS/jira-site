## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

According to ehcache.xsd a "cache" element is required to be a valid ehcache configuration. 
Either add a cache element to ehcache-failsafe or, which makes more sense IMHO, make the cache element optional in ehcache.xsd.

Hi

Agree with your recommendation. Done. This will be in 1.5 but it is trunk now.
