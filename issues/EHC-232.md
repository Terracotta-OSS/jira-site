## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

JMS replication performance can be improved by batching. When Ehcache is configured to use async replication then, instead of publishing a message for each cache update, group all updates received during the async time interval into a single message. This will provide significant improvements at the JMS/network layer and at the application layer.
