## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The eclipse plugin should use the system wide install of terracotta when TC\_HOME is set so that you can install a tim-module once system wide and you don't need to specify a new separate repository. With that the eclipse plugin would match more a environment as in staging/production where you wont have maven installed for downloading jars.
