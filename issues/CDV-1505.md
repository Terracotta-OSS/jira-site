<div markdown="1" class="comment">

To preserve backwards compatibility a new org.terracotta.api.ClusteringToolkitExtension interface has been introduced.

The ClusteringToolkit implementation returned by TerracottaClient.getToolkit() can be cast to ClusteringToolkitExtension which exposes the new unregister\* API calls.

This interface will be merged with ClusteringToolkit in the next major API release.
