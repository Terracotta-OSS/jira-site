## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

source: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/1301.page

For logical collections that use identity equal only (eg. LinkedBlockingQueue), the generated delegate method for equals() produces an incorrect result

Attached is a sample program and tc-config.xml.  In the instrumented version of the class bugs.Tests$Buggy, the equals() method is delegated and thus fails the object reference comparison.
