## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently DiskStore only allows Serializable objects. It would be nice if it allowed any arbitrary object and used a user supplied serializer to convert the object into bytes. The default implementation could work with serialization.

But what about replicators? We have RMI and JGroups which all require Serializable.

The change should also be applied there to be consistent.

I can see that this could be useful. If you are keen, can you please provide a patch and I will look at appling it for the upcoming 1.5. If you do the patch upload it to patches. In the meantime I will close the feature request.
