I wouldn't be the one to evaluate this request really, but I wonder if you could maybe expand some details about your use case for this?

If you'd like to put together a patch and sign up to be a code contributor that is always welcome :-)

Use case: Java SE desktop GIS
GIS system that works with rasters or vectors that are projected/scaled. EhCache can be used as BOUNDED temporary disk storage between runs.
