Gary, can you check on this from your side today?

I was under the impression that we would force a unique name on all CacheManagers.  Using the name is the only way to correlate the different MBeans across clients.

Here's what one currently gets, while there is a single entry in the CacheManager Map, I see 2 different CacheManagers in the EhCache panel... I find it surprising, so you guys tell me if that's what we want.

IMO, unnamed CacheManagers should get a default name such as "DefaultCacheManager."
Note the DevConsole cannot affect what the MBean names are.  This is a PM issue.  Once again, I thought we were going to require that TerracottaClustered CacheManagers have names.

I think this issue will be present even when we have "named" cachemanagers and running multiple vm's in same box. If we start two or more VM's/nodes with same cacheManager names in the same box, I think we'll see two items in the drop down in dev-console. This is when running 2 vm's in same box though.

General consensus seems to be that when cache managers have no defined name we should use the same default name in the GUI as is used to key the cache manager in the clustered store map.  That key would be "\1\1DEFAULT\1\1" (see TerracottaClusteredInstanceFactory).

Just stating the obvious, but cache manager names are very recent feature of Ehcache. I think that before v1.6 this wasn't even supported in the config. So we need to allow people to continue to use their old configs, also because cache manager names have little sense in a non clustered environment.

The issue of giving a default name to a clustered CacheManager depends on when we know the CacheManager is clustered.  Seems we can't know this early enough to set the name in CacheManager.init.  I think we either force a default name under all circumstances or leave it alone and document that a clustered CacheManager must have a name.

Or only leave a single hole: no mention of Terracotta in config, later dynamically add a TC-clustered cache without name.  This will handle most of the regular cases.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

There is still a problem where the CacheManager isn't configured for any TerracottaClustered caches but later they are added programatically.  But this change handles 90+% of the cases. In the future we might want to enforce a name at all times.
