## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Product/Component: Terracotta 

Version: Terracotta 2.7.3

Description: 
After ./stop-tc-server.sh stop, the log only has "Server exiting..." 
It should say "Server successfully exited" afterwards, or Moved to state [ something that shows it is stopped ] 
example log: 
[cguser@bzcgconlgmt01 fptool]$ cat terracotta-start\_bzcgconlgmt01.log 
2009-07-22 16:59:26,390 INFO - Terracotta 2.7.3, as of 20090129-100125 (Revision 11424 by cruise@su10mo5 from 2.7)

2009-07-22 17:09:07,167 INFO - Server exiting... 

Expected Behavior: 
Server exiting... as the only message makes it look like the server is hung trying to shut down. 

Actual Behavior: 
Should be a specific message saying the server is stopped or terminated. Note that the stdout has a good message, this should duplicate into the logs. 

Workaround: 
Look at the stdout and ps to make sure the process is gone.
