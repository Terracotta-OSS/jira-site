## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We do not support the 1.4 JDK for IBM, only 1.5.  As such, the IBM 1.4 JDK is used for both 1.4 and 1.5 environments in the build, which is normally not allowed.  We need to find a way for this to be allowed only in the case of IBM, not for Sun.

I think this issue would be best addressed by moving to Maven.
