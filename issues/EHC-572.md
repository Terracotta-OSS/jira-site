## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need to figure out how to (automatically if possible) get the Hibernate stats available as an mbean for use by the dev console.  We were doing this with agent instrumentation in the Terracotta cache provider - want to do this without instrumentation though.  Worst case, we could provide a choice for:

- use the agent to make it automatic
- provide docs on how to get the bean registered with the SessionFactory

Fixed. Use JNDI (if session factory name is provided) otherwise reflectively find out the sessionFactory (using Properties.equals()) iterating on SessionFactoryObjectFactory.INSTANCES

Dev-console hibernate cache panel is working and showing stats.
