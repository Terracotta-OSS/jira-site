## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Overflow of non-serializable objects to Disk Cache will result in DEBUG or WARNING message?


4.3.1 Supports Object or Serializable caching

... are discarded without error and with a DEBUG level log message


13.2 Disk Store

... will be removed instead, and a WARNING
level log message emitted.


I believe section 13.2 is correct.
