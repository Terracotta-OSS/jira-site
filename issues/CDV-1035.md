## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The TCLogging.getLogger() method only accepts the "com.tc" namespace.  At the very least, it should accept "org.terracotta".  It is often appropriate in a TIM to report log messages - for instance, "Encountered an unexpected method while instrumenting class 'Foo'".

In fact I am not sure why there is a restriction at all.  Are user-written TIMs required to be in the org.terracotta namespace?  If not, how should they report instrumentation failures?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I think we should remove the restriction on TCLogging packages.  

Separately, we may want to consider recommended practice for how to log as a TIM.  This might (probably will) be different answers for "tim code run during instrumentation" vs "tim code run as normal library" and I would suggest creating some official response for the former and leaving it up to a user for the latter, with TCLogging as a possible choice.
