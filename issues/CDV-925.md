General issue is "I've upgraded from 2.6.2 to 2.7.0, now when I connect with the 2.7.0 admin console the servers section appears in red saying that it's unable to connect to servers (active passive mode). When I run the 2.6.2 admin console against the 2.7.0 Terracotta servers it connects and works correctly; ignoring the upgrade warnings. "

Gary is looking at the issue. More information can be found in the forums

Can you look into this in 2.7.x timeframe. Is it a bug, what should we do to test it.

The machine on which the console is running needs to be able to resolve and connect to the host names listed in the server elements of the config file.
