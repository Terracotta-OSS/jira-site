## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the case of disposing, the underlying replicationQueue of an (async) distributed cache will be cleared. That means the remaining entries will be discarded. It would be desirable that (it is configurable that) the queue will be flushed to the peers.

Current code
 class RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator \{
   ... 
   public final void dispose() \{
        status = Status.STATUS_SHUTDOWN;
        synchronized (replicationQueue) {
            replicationQueue.clear();
        }
   \}
   ... 
\}

Alternative approach??

class RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator \{
   ... 
   public final void dispose() \{
        status = Status.STATUS_SHUTDOWN;
        if (flushOnDispose) {
             flushReplicationQueue();
        } else {
             synchronized (replicationQueue) {
                 replicationQueue.clear();
             }
        }
   \}
   ... 
\}

Hi

This is an oversight in the implementation. 

I think 

/\*\*
     * Give the replicator a chance to flush the replication queue, then cleanup and free resources when no longer needed
     */
    public final void dispose() {
        status = Status.STATUS_SHUTDOWN;
        flushReplicationQueue();
    }

does the job. I am not sure why we would want to make this a configuration option. There should be an expectation that it might take a distributed cache a few seconds to shut down.
