## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If ehcache has been configured to use multicast for peer
discovery (RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory) but multicast
packets are being rejected by a firewall then ehcache
consumes all CPU and exhibits excessive logging at level
debug.

The problem is MulticastKeepaliveHeartbeatSender: when the
send on line 135 fails the IOException is caught and another
send is immediately retried, effectively sending this whole
thing into tight loop. The solution is to make sure to wait
a little bit after an error is encountered. The attached
simple patch does this, but an improvement might be to use
a backoff mechanism so that the send is immediately retried
after an error, but if the error persists then successively
longer waits are done between retries.

The attached patch also ensures the stack trace from the
IOException is logged so it's clear where exactly the
exception is being thrown.

Applied to trunk. Will be in 1.4.

The problem with distributed anything is all the network stuff that can go wrong. I think your patch is a sensible de-spamming.
