## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The JMX ObjectName of the DSO MBean has changed since 2.5 so even though you can successfully connect to a 2.5 server, nothing appears in the tree panel.  We could work-around this by explicitly looking for the old name if we cannot find the new one.

As long as version incompatibility  error shows up we are OK.
