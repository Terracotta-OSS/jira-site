## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

1. in expireElements(), avoid loading the element from
the file if there are no cache 
   listeners to notify. This will speed up expiration
process dramatically when there 
   are no listeners. In my case - we NEVER have
listeners and therefore incur quite a 
   significant hit when the expriy thread is executing.

2. RegisteredEventListener - this is picky I know,
but... avoid calling iterator() 
   (and an object allocation) if there are no
listeners. Also - add method to support 
   avoiding loading of element in expireElements()
named RegisteredEventListeners.hasCacheEventListeners().

3. Change flushSpool avoid copy of map into array using
a simple reference 
   swap and separate lock. This avoid memory copy and
decreases lock time. Albeit, 
   the time was already short - this just make it shorter.
