## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the case of disposing, the underlying replicationQueue of an (async) distributed cache will be cleared. That means the remaining entries will be discarded. It would be desirable that (it is configurable that) the queue will be flushed to the peers.

Current code
 class RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator \{
   ... 
   public final void dispose() \{
        status = Status.STATUS_SHUTDOWN;
        synchronized (replicationQueue) {
            replicationQueue.clear();
        }
   \}
   ... 
\}

Alternative approach??

class RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator \{
   ... 
   public final void dispose() \{
        status = Status.STATUS_SHUTDOWN;
        if (flushOnDispose) {
             flushReplicationQueue();
        } else {
             synchronized (replicationQueue) {
                 replicationQueue.clear();
             }
        }
   \}
   ... 
\}
