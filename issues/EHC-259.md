## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We would like to be able to configure a Cache to user
SoftReferences.

This is because we want the cache to be able to cache a
lot of items, but when the load becomes high, and more
memory is needed, cached items should be able to get
collected..

Right now swarmcache is the only cache doing this.


Of course we could put a softref in the cache but:
- We cannot control how hibernate put stuff in the
cache by configuring.
- if the softref gets collected, the cache still has an
element in it's map
