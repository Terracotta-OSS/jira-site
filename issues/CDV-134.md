## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

DSO inserts instrumentation before calls to Object.clone() to resolve all fields such that the VMs built in shallow copy will not see fields that are null simply becuase they are unresolved (in the DSO sense). 

TCObjectPhysical.resolveAllRefrerences fails to walk the class hierarchy to resolve the fields present in any super classes

The symptom of this is that fields in the cloned object will be null if the application had never read (ie. resolved) the fields of the instance to be cloned. This only affects non-literal fields (since literal fields are never unresolved)
