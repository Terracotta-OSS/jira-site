I don't know much about spring+ehcache annotations -- is this our code or someone else's?

We certainly do have docs on this type of construct (in addition to the javadoc); enter selfpopulatingcache in the search box on ehcache.org. But we don't have much about spring usage or these annotations.

ehcache-annotations is an external project.

Greg wrote up a little piece on it here
http://ehcache.org/documentation/recipes/spring-annotations

But the user perhaps needs to be directed to the actual owners of this code if their issue indeed lies with ehcache-annotations
http://code.google.com/p/ehcache-spring-annotations/

Marking as resolved. Ehcache annotations is an external project and not maintained by us.
