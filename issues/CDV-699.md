## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

A servlet is to be created to report on the server status.  The servlet can be hit via scripts to aid in the management of networked active-passive clusters.

Currently jetty is not available until the l1Listener is started.  Since the purpose of the servlet is to verify that a server has become the active-coordinator, this state of affairs is acceptable.
