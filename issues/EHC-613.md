## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently the SAX Parser instances we use to parse the ehcache.xml configuration files do not validate those files against the schema.  The BeanHandler does provide some limited validation since it will throw if attributes do not have matching methods, but thats about all it does enforce.  We had this correctly working in tim-hibernate-cache so it shouldn't be too hard to replicate this in Ehcache.

Looking in the XSD, I realize you might want to change it as well, should validation be done using it:
right now it defines multiple elements, which means every of these element is valid as a root element. e.g.:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>

is a valid xml document wrt ehcache.xsd. You might want to change refs to concrete types... Just something to think about.
