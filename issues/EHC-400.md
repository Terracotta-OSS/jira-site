<div markdown="1" class="comment">

JCacheStatistics.testStatisticsFromStatisticsObject() - there was an error in the new stats stuff where the 2 miss values were not being coalesced for the JCache stats.  I will submit that I'm about 75% sure I disagree with the assertion that was failing in the first place.  If you ask the cache for a key and it misses in both the memorystore and the diskstore, that's recorded as two (different kinds) of misses and the JCache version of the stats adds these values together.  That seems weirdly wrong to me.  But behavior is now consistent between releases at least.

JCacheListener.testExpiryNotifications() - test was too sensitive due to change from millis to second resolution

JCacheListener.testEvictionFromLRUMemoryStoreExpiry() - due to change in threshold and random eviction, this test assumption no longer holds.  made all objects not serializable to always trigger expected behavior.

Fixed JCacheEntryTests - all timing related.
