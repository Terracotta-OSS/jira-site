## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

On the Mac, Spinners aren't accepting values that are typed, always reverting back to the default value.
Fix is to use a selection listener to notices changes instead of listening for the ACCEPT key.

Workaround is to use the UP/DOWN buttons to change the value.
