## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think that you have a concurrency bug in net.sh.ehcache.Cache linked to the memory store.

The method Cache.put() can be executed while the method Cache.dispose() is beeing executed by another Thread.

Example:

Thread 1: call Cache.put()
Thread 2: call Cache.dispose()
At this point, the execution of Cache.dispose() finished, then memoryStore = null.
Thread 1: Cache.put() continues its execution and try to add the element to the memory store (memoryStore.put(element);)
=> the method crashed with a NullPointerException because the Cache a set to null the memory store.

We experienced this problem in our production environment using EhCache 1.2.4 and this problem looks still present in 1.5.
