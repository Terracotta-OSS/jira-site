## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Not sure if we'll be able to see this in any S3 logs, but I think the http requests that tim-get makes should include some identification. Specifically something that makes it clear that it is tim-get making the request, and think the TC version should be in there too. 

Recent mavens do something like this I believe

Verified with 3.3.0 build5 (Revision 7792-15806), tim-get script prints the Terracotta version as expected.
