This can obviously only work if Serializable keys and values are being used. 

Since this isn't a clustered cache, copy-on-read here I assume is for the use case of making it impossible to affect the cache w/o a put()/remove()/etc call. If that is true, this feature really needs to make sure we're doing copy-on-write too here. We do that in the clustered store just not explicitly. For unclustered we're going to need to do it explicitly.
