## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

With a small test case app, I'm seeing NullPointerExceptions when then disk store tries to persist.  AFAICT, the cause is in LfuPolicy.leastHit(), which returns the field "justAdded", which is set to null.

Backtrace and test case attached.

Hi

Nice test case. I have added it to LfuMemoryStoreTest. The thing that triggers it is the max disk store size of 1. The issue does not happen if the max disk store size is 2 or higher.

I changed the offending line to if (sampledElements.length == 1 && justAdded != null).

The fix is in trunk and will be in ehcache-1.4.
