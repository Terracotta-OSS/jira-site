## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We would like to add a tc:clean goal to maven.

This goal should delete the logs and data directories specified in the tc-config.xml.

As a first pass, it's probably reasonable if the goal doesn't support all of the possible wildcards that can be specified in the tc-config.xml, and some wildcards may be downright impossible - if it is time based for example - so let's just cover the common case at a minimum of the directories that are created by default if they are not specified in the config.

If they are specified in the config, it would be nice to be able to support those, if the wildcards in the specification permit..

Committed first cut into the trunk and 2.5 branch.

There is a configuration parameter failOnError (true by default) that can be used to make tc:clean ignore errors when stopping DSO server and deleting logs and data folders.

Note that plugin won't be able to handle substitution parameters %d and %D (respectively unique temp dir and datestamp). Please comment if we need to add special handling for those.

I've just tried tc:clean with the sample project "tc-maven-plugin-sample"

It only cleans server data and logs but not client logs.

Reproduce:

"mvn tc:run"  to create logs and data

then "mvn tc:clean", then check target/terracotta/master, you'll see the log in there.

Should we mark this issue as resolved and handle what is left using separate bug reports?
