## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When evicting, we first select the victim, then we remove it.
To do so, we eventually invoke remove(K, V) on CHMv8 passing the Element chosen as the victim as V. Now, you can't compare Elements using equals as they return true if their keys are equal, which will always be true. What we really mean here is object identity equality actually. 

CHMv8 should not try and do a valueToCompare.equals(entryValue) if valueToCompare is an Element instance. 

This currently is racy in the HeapCachingTier, if the victim gets replaced before we get to remove it, we'll remove it anyways...
