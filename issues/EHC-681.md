## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Ehcache-core 2.0 has read-through and write-through/behind functionality but ehcache--server doesn't support it. It should be easy to implement it for SOAP. For REST it can be more tricky due to protocol limitations, but it can be done using http request headers just like it's been done with ehcacheTimeToLiveSeconds, modifying base get and put requests. For me it's 10 minute hack, but something "official" would be better :)
