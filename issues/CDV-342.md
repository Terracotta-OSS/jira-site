## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

run-dgc.sh|bat outputs the following:

2007-07-26 23:18:05,359 INFO - Terracotta 2.4-stable1, as of 20070622-150631 (Revision 3946 by cruise@rh4mo0 from 2.4)
2007-07-26 23:18:05,363 ERROR - Please indicate hostname and jmxport when running this script.

This does not indicate the syntax or format of the required parameters.

Fix:

Add a usage section in conformance with a typical unix usage section that indicates the format of the parameters.  The usage should contain a description of what the script does.
