## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

1.5+ is the supported JDK for server.  If server is started with any other unsupported jdk we should throw a reasonable error

It should go without saying, but there should be a test that attempts to start the server using 1.4 and does some reasonable verification of the output. Mostly the reason I say this is that it is pretty easy to write perfect code for this, but if that code is in a 1.5 module, you'll probably get an UnsupportedClassVersionError long before your "jdk version check" code can even run -- that is NOT a reasonable error though!
