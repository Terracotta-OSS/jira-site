## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/549.page

The monitor on the TCObject is held for the duration of dehydrateIfNew(). If the dehydration makes any callbacks on the target object (eg. logical object's iterator), and said callbacks acquire locks, it's pretty easy to get a lock order problem as we see here.
