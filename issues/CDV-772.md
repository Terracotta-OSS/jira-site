The Spring tests that have suddenly begun failing for Spring 2.0.8 are also failing for Spring 2.0.5.  Hung and Jason uncovered a build problem which was resulting in the Spring container tests always running with only Spring 2.0.1 in the classpath.  Now that Hung has fixed the problem, we've confirmed that these tests failed all along for Spring 2.0.5.  

So I just wanted you to know that holding my 2.0.8 changes back won't fix these tests, meanwhile my changes do fix Spring events in Spring 2.0.8 and fix other test failures.  So imho they should go in.

Meanwhile I'll be working on fixing these tests as well as Spring 2.5.x support.

The three tests that are failing are CustomScopedBeanTest (2 test failures) and SessionScopedBeanTest (1 failure).

fixed in trunk (rev 8824) and 2.6 (8825).  This fixes failing tests for Spring 2.0.5/2.0.8.

The root of the problem was that org.springframework.aop.config.ScopedProxyBeanDefinitionDecorator changed a lot from Spring 2.0.1 to 2.0.5 to 2.0.8.  This is in the guts of Spring's aop interceptors, decorators and proxies, and there is a lot of room for leeway in Spring's implementation.  I'm still fearful that our code (SpringAspectModule) is too tightly bound to the Spring source code - could use some refactoring imho.

Rev 8936 - all tests passing now for Spring 2.5.4 variant.  Not sure I'm confident saying we "support" Spring 2.5 yet...

As of yesterday all automated tests are passing for all Spring variants we test, including 2.0.8 and 2.5.4.
