## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

HashMapTC and HashtableTC calls fixTCObjectReferenceOfClonedObject() but doesnt call resolveAllReferencesBeforeClone() before cloning. This might cause it to create a partially resolved clone. 

PS : calling resolveAllReferencesBeforeClone() for a huge map is a big overhead.

PSS: just calling resolveAllReferencesBeforeClone() will not work for Map as resolveAllReference is not implemented for TCLogicalObjects.
