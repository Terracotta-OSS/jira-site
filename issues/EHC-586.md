## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

SimpleCachingHeadersPageCachingFilter and SimplePageCachingFilter are both subject to body/entity disregards/short-circuits of anything but HTTP status codes sent from filters lower down the chain. This causes problems for RESTful services (I.e. Jersey/JSR-311) which relies on HTTP 3xx as well as 4xx response codes along with an associated entity/body for human troubleshooting and potentially machine consumption.

I am not sure about the motivation behind the currently observed short-cutting behavior, but this does not appear to be mandated behavior by RFC 2616 [http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html]. So I think the current behavior is wrong and does not play well with REST principles. Patch submitted.

Fixed, but please keep in mind that the default CachingFilter implementation is to only cache when the HTTP status code is 200.

Now when a request is made which returns something else than HTTP 200, the payload is not truncated anymore but still not cached.
