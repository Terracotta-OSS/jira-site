## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When using commons-collections-3.1 tim that comes with the kit, there is no config for org.apache.commons.collections.map.LRUMap and gives the following error message:

Attempt to share an instance of a non-portable class by assigning it to a root. This unshareable
class has not been included for sharing in the configuration.

For more information on this issue, please visit our Troubleshooting Guide at:
http://terracotta.org/kit/troubleshooting

Thread                : main
JVM ID                : VM(6)
Non-portable root name: LRUMapTest.map
Non-included classes  : org.apache.commons.collections.map.LRUMap, org.apache.commons.collections.map.AbstractLinkedMap, org.apache.commons.collections.map.AbstractHashedMap

Action to take:

1) Reconfigure to include the unshareable classes
   \* edit your tc-config.xml file
   \* locate the <dso> element
   \* add this snippet inside the <dso> element

       <instrumented-classes>
         <include>
           <class-expression>org.apache.commons.collections.map.LRUMap</class-expression>
         </include>
         <include>
           <class-expression>org.apache.commons.collections.map.AbstractLinkedMap</class-expression>
         </include>
         <include>
           <class-expression>org.apache.commons.collections.map.AbstractHashedMap</class-expression>
         </include>
       </instrumented-classes>

   \* if there is already an <instrumented-classes> element present, simply add
     the new includes inside it

It is possible that some or all of the classes above are truly non-portable, the solution
is then to mark the referring field as transient.
