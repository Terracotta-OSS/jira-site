## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

An unexpected side effect of calling Ehcache.evictExpiredElements() is that it updates the memoryStoreHitCount and missCountExpired statistics. 

Looking at the code Cache.evictExpiredElements() calls searchInMemoryStore(Object, boolean) and passes false for the boolean to disable statistics updating but that value only seems to apply to the get call and not the incrementing of memoryStoreHitCount and missCountExpired later in the call.

We're using Ehcache.evictExpiredElements() in a timer to periodically flush expired objects from the caches and having the stats being affected by the calls makes checking on actual cash usage stats hard to read.

If we don't want to change the existing behavior of Cache.evictExpiredElements() perhaps adding a Cache.quietEvictExpiredElements() method to result in flushing of expired entries with no stats updating.
