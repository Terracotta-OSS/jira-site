## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There are no total statistics. I would not be able to use the per second stats for performance tuning.

Suggest another view which is not the last observation but the sum of all observations for that CacheManager since it started. This should be coupled with a "Clear Statistics" which resets it. 

Some stats:
Total Hits
Hit Ratio (total hits/total requests)
Percentage from Memory Store (Memory Store Hits/Total Hits)

This was referred to in the original spec.
- stats
- cache efficiency hits/misses etc.

There should also be graphs showing the time series for these as well as Total Elements, Total Memory Store Elements, Total Disk Store Elements.

A time period should be selectable for the graph and the totals.

This would necessitate collection of the data by the monitor, which can be historically referenced which was envisaged in the original spec thus the mention of Derby DB.
- Derby DB


All of the custom monitoring software that I have ever seen, at Wotif, Novell, clients, and in commerical tools we use has this property. The ones that don't are the simple ones like Visual VM and JConsole.
