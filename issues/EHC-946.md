## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There have been numerous bug-fixes made in the Ehcache test code to make the tests more robust.  In particular there have been numerous fixes to the RMI replication tests that are obviously very prone to timing issues.  Since the perf tests are in separate sandboxed area they haven't received any of these fixes.

To fix this I think it would be good to move the perf tests back in to the regular tests folder and to enable them by having a profile that changes the surefire test pattern.  This way they can share in all the love that the regular unit tests have received.
