## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I am unable to load an EhCache configuration file from a class loader other then the one that loaded EhCache.

I am attempting to use ehcache with hibernate and the EhCacheProvider insists on the path to the configuration file (as defined in the net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName property)being preceeded with a '/'.  
 
This prevents the file being loaded by EhCacheProvider using the classloader forcing it to defer to the class's classloader.  
 
Using a preceding slash when calling ClassLoader.getResource is not used for this reason as documented here http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/lang/resources.html#classloader. 
 
This forces any configuration file to be accessible by the same classloader that loaded EhCache. 

This can easily be reproduced by locating the ehcache.jar in the jre/lib/ext directory and pustting the config file on the system classpath.
