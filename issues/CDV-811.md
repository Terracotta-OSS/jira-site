## Description

xxx
- print out patch level info at the beginning of all commands
- limit config sample to main tim
- put legends in info command output
- change text: legends -> legend
- add meta information regarding quality of TIM in bundle's manifest
- exact match on tcversion
- add a line in diagnostic when tim can't be resolved to suggest using the them tim-get tool

Fixed everything except:
- add meta information regarding quality of TIM in bundle's manifest 

Still, waiting for actual name of this field.

If anything here is a new feature check with DRB before doing it (or Fiona, Alex, Steve)

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

From the list, the following I think would/could be considered a New Feature in TC but is required to complete CDV-811:
- add meta information regarding quality of TIM in bundle's manifest 
- add a line in diagnostic when tim can't be resolved to suggest using the them tim-get tool 

The first one is an additional attribute (proposed Terracotta-Rating) into the manifest of the TIMs that we produce.
If it does not exists, then the process that produces the data for the tim-get tool will simply use the value "NONE" (so we don't have to add it in our TIM manifests yet)

The second one involves modifying/updating the summary text printed when a TIM is not found.

CDV-811 is resolved, so the ff is also completed:
- add a line in diagnostic when tim can't be resolved to suggest using the them tim-get tool
