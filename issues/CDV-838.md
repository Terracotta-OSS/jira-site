## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We have a hard coded rule that any class in a package starting with "com.tc." is automatically and silently excluded from instrumentation. This has bitten TC people a number of times (I wouldn't imagine anyone outside TC would try that package name or perhaps the real owners of the tc.com domain) 

I don't think just removing the rule is the right thing to do. It seems we need to either generate warnings, or allow exceptions to the rule somehow

If we put this in, it may generate warnings from our own code
