## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Monitoring solutions (Ganglia, Advent Manage Engine, Hyperic) typically allow a JXM property to be polled and graphs produced. I'd like to be able to do this for cache effectiveness; e.g. 96% cache hits.

Moving all unresolved "Fix Revision 2.2.1" to fix revision "unknown" as we are releasing Magnum first which is 2.3. Currently not sure which fix version these will actually be in, but they are targeted for Fremantle release

I believe a much more interesting number to have when monitoring the performance of a cache is to have the % cache hit for a given region only (instead of a % of all hits of all regions).

This (trunk) patch does just that.

Also, I have completed the \{\{CacheStatistics\}\} (and associated \{\{CacheStatisticsMBean\}\}) to be feature-complete: there were missing a few off-heap-related numbers.
