## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

a) we need a well defined representation as a string of a nodeid
b) set it at startup in the system properties to make it easy to read for users
c) must match the value that one gets from jmx

d) optional - we could optionally also update as nodes join / leave a "# of nodes in the cluster" system property



</div>
