## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi,
I am using the cachingfilter with SOAP messages.  If I got a SOAP fault it has status code 500 which corresponds to the SOAP specs.  The cachingfilter does recognize this as internal server error and responds with its own 500 page.  At least it does not just forward the contents of the original http response.
I fixed the problem by overriding:

net.sf.ehcache.constructs.web.filter.CachingFilter.doFilter where I simply uncommented this stuff:

        //return on error or redirect code
        int statusCode = pageInfo.getStatusCode();
        if (statusCode != HttpServletResponse.SC_OK) {
            return;
        }

I am not sure but I believe this is a bug.

Cheers,
Tobias

The current trunk of ehcache-web has the code uncommented so I guess the bug got resolved somewhere.

It is in ehcache-web, which is a separate download/maven module in ehcache-1.6.
