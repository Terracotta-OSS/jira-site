## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently we cannot support interleaving transactions for the Atomikos TM.
This means:

Transaction tx = txnManager.suspend();

txnManager.resume() does not work.

this is due to the combination of Atomikos not calling XAResource.end() upon suspend() and not properly implementing hashcode() for their transaction class.

Already posted issues to Atomikos forum. There bug tracking software is not available to those without developer support.

Email correspondence so far:

Hello guy,

Thank you for your quick response! and the hashcode() fix.
As for the second issue, I'm not saying that I want to delist the reasource(), simply asking if it is possible to call
XAResource.end() when suspend() is called.

Consider the following scenario:

txnManager.begin()
txnManager.suspend()
txnmanager.begin()

Unless I enlist the resource repeated on every transaction operation (i.e cache operations for me) I won't know if
suspend was ever call. It just makes is way more easier for the XAResource implementor side.

What i was imagining is something like this:

txnManager.begin()
   ... some cache operation
          -> check thread local for running xid, doesn't exist
                       -> enlist -> which calls XaResource.start()

txnManager.suspend()
         -> call XaResouce.end()
                       -> remove xid from thread local

txnManager.begin()
   ... some cache operation
         -> check thread local for running xid, doesn't exist
                       -> enlist -> which calls XaResource.start()

Thanks!

-Nabib

I still didn't hear back from these guys.. Is it safe to say they disagree? If that's so, we current don't support suspend()/resume() for Atomikos. The hashcode() fix may help us come up with a solution.

Isn't this issue related to DEV-3885 ? Once again I'd like to better understand why you need the EhCache XAResource to be notified when a transaction suspension occurs.

This is solved by EHC-649 but the test suite described in DEV-3887 is still missing to prove it.

These two tests already existed in terracotta-ehcache but were disabled because they were broken: SuspendResumeAtomikosXATest and TwoResource SuspendResumeAtomikosXATest

I've re-actived them as they now work.
