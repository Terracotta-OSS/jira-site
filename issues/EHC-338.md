## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi

This is a patch for the bug about not being able to run
on IBM WebSphere using JDK1.4 and still require the
commons-collection.jar in the classpath. Even though
EHCache will use java.util.LinkedHashMap and not
anything from commons-collection.

Basically I have moved the inner class SpoolingLRUMap
to a seperate class and uses reflection to instanciate
this class. Using reflection avoids having import
statements to any org.apache.commons.collection.

This works nicely on IBM WebSphere 5.1 running on
JDK1.4. I have tried to use the EHCache with both:
- java.util.LinkedHashMap
- org.apache.commons.collections.LRUMap (disabling the
JDK14 check in MemoryStore.java)

I have attached a diff and the two .java files.

I hope you would consider adding this patch to a future
release avoid the need for commons-collections totally
for JDK14 environments.

We do not use Hibernate and the cache is used in the
ejb.jar and not in the .war file. So classpath issues
here is a bit more tricky. Especially when there is
also hot-deployment. That is why I changed the
Class.ForName("xxx") to use a j2ee friendly strategy.
See the source.

Thanks for a still in-development cache framework.
OSCache seems to have dropped it pace and that is why I
changed to EHCache instead.
