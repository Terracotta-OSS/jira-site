## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This issue is related to CDV-636

Our nightly kit has its version encoded as "2.6-nightly-rev8431", for example, this is reported from a kit:

2008-05-02 14:16:51,390 INFO - Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev8431, as of 20080501-180547 (Revision 8431 by cruise@rh4mo0 from 2.6)

However, our TIMs have maven style version which is 2.6.0-SNAPSHOT for a nightly kit.

So if you want use the TIM version check from CDV-636, you won't be able to use "enforce", "strict" mode with a nightly because the kit's default modules don't even have their versions match with the kit's version.

Discussed many times how strict to be on version checking. This is working as designed I believe. But may need to re-review at some point
