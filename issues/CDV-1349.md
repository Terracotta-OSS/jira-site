## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When using express client we write temporary tc-config.xml files to disk in order to bootstrap L1 Clients. 

I'm certain this in unnecessary -- if we can construct the file we can just as easily pass it as a String in memory to the code that needs it. It was going to take some surgery to get that done so I delayed doing it for 3.1.0

Once we clean this up we should be able to suppress the console messages that show the use of temporary files, for example:

2009-08-04 16:04:21,301 INFO - Configuration loaded from the file at 'C:\DOCUME~1\teck\Local Settings\Temp\tc-config8401279633800709608.xml'.

This aspect is true of all express/standalone things, not just H2LC express
