## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, you have to trawl several levels deep to find the actual data in a CDM.  Console should display the idealized view instead of the full structure for a CDM.

We should do the same for ConcurrentDistributedSet I just added to tim-concurrent-collections too
