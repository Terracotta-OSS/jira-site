## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The usability improvement I developed during dev week is now at the point were you can monitor and add arbitrary bean shell hooks to methods in instrumented classes.  This jira is to track whether or not these changes get merged back into the core product.

The changes in question are in the "chrisgeert\_trace" branch of the core (only exists in OSS).
