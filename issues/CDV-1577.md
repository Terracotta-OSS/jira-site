I have attached the simple test case and here is the output of that test case (on a local machine):

Here is a snippet of my log file (the interesting part).

Hi, Can you try with 3.5.1 I believe we improved shutdown time in that version. Can you give that a try and let us know

Just downloaded it and it works great, running the exact same code I'm up to 3 sec for startup and 5 seconds (instead of 30) for shutdown! Thanks ;) Now to plan on migrating...
