## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since Ehcache depends on Java 5, we can now use java.util.UUID when java.rmi.server.UID is not available (e.g. Google AppEngine). This is better than using System.currentTimeMillis().

Or maybe ditch UID entirely and have 1 code for all environments?
