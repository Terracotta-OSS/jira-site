## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I don't know what is really going wrong, and jboss 6 is not yet a supported platform (at the time this JIRA was created), but jboss fails to start if the dso-boot.jar is in place for custom mode. 

No idea if express has any issues with jboss 6 or not
