## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Running sample/pojo/chatter from 2.4.4, an assertion error was thrown on my passive L2 server when an L1 client was closed.

2007-10-11 15:29:45,611 INFO - Moved to State[ PASSIVE-UNINITIALIZED ]
2007-10-11 15:29:45,728 INFO - Moved to State[ PASSIVE-STANDBY ]
java.lang.AssertionError: This should never be called.

I've attached the modified tc-config.xml. The two L2 servers have this config as well, and were started like this:

mrm@ha01:~$ ~/terracotta-2.4.4/bin/start-tc-server.sh -f ~/tc-config.xml

A spoke to someone who believe this is fixed in trunk (the basis for the upcoming 2.5.x terracotta release). He will confirm shortly
