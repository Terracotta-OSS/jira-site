## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Based on the ehcache 2.5 beta feedback: "If I annotate a class with @IgnoreSizeOf , how come I have to annotate all the subclasses?"
We probably shouldn't have @IgnoreSizeOf annotated with @Inherited, but add a :

boolean inherited() default false;

to the @IgnoreSizeOf annotation

</div>

Looks like http://ehcache.org/documentation/beta/configuration#ignoring-for-size-calculations requires an update.
So know you can use @IgnoreSizeOf(inherited = true), which will result in all subclasses being ignored as well. Obviously this will only affect when the annotation is used on a type.
