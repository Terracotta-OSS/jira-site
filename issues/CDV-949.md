## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The clients/dso/debugging/runtime-logging/non-portable-dump feature is a fantastic way of debugging TCNonPortableObjectError. It would be nice if the troubleshooting page (http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/wiki/Troubleshooting+Guide) could mention it.
