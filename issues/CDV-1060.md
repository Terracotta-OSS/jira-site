## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

"auto-synchronize" allows people to insert method level synchronization where it does not naturally exist. I believe the feature is an alternative to named locking and should really only be used for code that the user cannot change (like a library). 

I don't think users have any business doing such things to JDK types (eg. java.\1) though. This feature is to disallow auto-synchronize for all boot jar classes

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

docs could be rewritten to exactly that effect: if  you are using 3rd-party libraries which lack synchronization, and you need locking, here's a way. add instructions and examples to make target of auto-synchronize very specific.
