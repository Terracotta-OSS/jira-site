## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The auto-enablement of the Hibernate value mode optimizations can cause problems when sharing caches between JVMs where some have Hibernate on the classpath and some don't.  Adding a system property that disables the hibernate value mode optimizations should suffice as a work-around in those situations.

I have added the "net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.disable-optimization" system property - when set to true (-Dnet.sf.ehcache.hibernate.disable-optimization=true) it forces use of the ordinary serialization value mode - it will also log a message indicating the disabled state.

Added test coverage - HalfHibernateTest in terracotta-ehcache (tc-3.6 branch).
