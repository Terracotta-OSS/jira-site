Need to build a nice pretty externally consumable non-Mavenized package of Examinator.  Of course, the best way to do this is probably by using a lot of Maven...  :)

Q1: should it also include TC itself?

Q2: is it okay to require MySQL to already be installed (include directions in the docs, as we do on Examinator web page already)?  At least for the first version of this, until we can support using Examinator with an embedded DB such as h2?

Q3: I assume we do NOT need to include JMeter or any of the perf test stuff?

Q4: I assume we do NOT need to include a browser?

I'm imagining the approach here is to create a Forge project that depends on Examinator (and on Jetty etc.) and produces a single .tar file containing everything needed to deploy and run Examinator, on two nodes, on one machine, as in the Examinator web page docs, modulo the above questions.

Q1: I think this is an open question. Given that examinator includes specific TIMs with dependency on specific TC version, there is only one possible tc version it can be run with.  So, I think it would be reasonable to include that kit in a package.  But I also think it would be reasonable for that to be a separate download.  
Q2: I say yes for 2.7.3 timeframe, maybe no for later. 
Q3: Correct, no jmeter (at least that's my opinion).
Q4: Correct :)  This was a joke right?


BTW, ran across this which may have some useful hints towards future swapping of dbs:

I don't know if this is helpful but something I have done is to write some simple instructions on downloading and using and then try to make the software match those instructions. Then iterate back and forth as one learns.

agree with all alex's stuff above.

Regarding this issue DEV-2257, Examinator won't start with Jetty with Terracotta enable. Are still packaging it with Jetty then?

### **Hung Huynh** <span class="date">2009-01-08</span>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Jetty-6.1.11.zip file is quite big, it's ~ 20MB while tomcat-6.0.18.zip is only 6.4MB

Given all the problem with jetty in windows, should we consider packaging Examinator with Tomcat instead?

I'd be curious to know why jetty is so big, historically it was quite small.

packaging process is now incorporated into examinator maven project.
Just run "mvn package" to create the zip file under target/packaging

README needs to describe how to load the schema into mysql.
i.e. what is the command line, what is the name of the database that should be used. any specific
username and password?

Sample package can be found here http://fileserver/ftp/pub/tmp/examinator-1.0.3-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
Would need TC 2.7.3-nightly to run

### **Himadri Singh** <span class="date">2009-01-19</span>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The fix is verified.
Using "mvn package -P tc-package", tar file is created under target/packaging/examinator-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz, this works with 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT.

mysql -u root < conf/schema.sql creates the new database/schema.

examinator tc-2.7 svn version-13164
examinator trunk svn versions-13163

There is a minor change made to rev-13162 on tc-2.7 and trunk.

The packaged examinator tar file is available on kong (http://kong.terracotta.lan/output/release-kits/2.7/2.7.3-opensource/examinator-1.0.3.tar.gz). The steps followed to verify the fix are same as in README.
