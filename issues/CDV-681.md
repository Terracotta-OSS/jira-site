## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

seems our default ip address to connect to is to determine the ip address of some interface, rather than use localhost (or 127.0.0.1)

This can be problematic on a laptop when it switches network - localhost doesn't go away, but the presence or absence of external networking can cause the systems to be dependent on external networking, even when it's not being used.

I think what Taylor is suggesting is that we change host="%i" to host="localhost" in all the samples.  I don't see a reason not to do this.

From Tim
I could have sworn we made them all "%i" so that demos could run multi-machine without changes.
