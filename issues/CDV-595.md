## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I got this from Passenger:

We have been doing testing and found that in 2.4.6 and even in 2.4.8 the API used in the TimeExpiryMemoryStore.java is not up to date with EHCache 1.3 when getting the configuration information. We have made the change in the class to make our application work. Please add this to the main branch so future releases do not needed to be patched.
 
Following code changed:
 
      long threadIntervalSec = cache.getCacheConfiguration().getDiskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds();
      long timeToIdleSec = cache.getCacheConfiguration().getTimeToIdleSeconds();
      long timeToLiveSec = cache.getCacheConfiguration().getTimeToLiveSeconds();
 
Original code:
 
      long threadIntervalSec = cache. getDiskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds();
      long timeToIdleSec = cache. getTimeToIdleSeconds();
      long timeToLiveSec = cache. getTimeToLiveSeconds();

2.4.8 has clustered ehcache 1.3 fix in 2.5 for 2.5.1

TimeExpiryMemoryStore is in clustered-ehcache-commons-1.0 and is (presumably) used for both ehcache 1.3 and 1.2.4.  The description mentions only 1.3, so will this change break 1.2.4?

I haven't looked at the source yet but my understanding is that the API change happened in 1.3. So, this class should probably moved from ehcache-commons to ehcache.

I've been working on this jira and actually have everything working and all tests passing but I wanted to mention something before I commit.  From getting our unit tests to work, I found that there seems to be a difference in behavior in 1.3 and I just wanted to mention it in case it raises any flags.

It seems that calling Ehcache.getDiskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds() will return the defaultCache setting overlaid by the specific cache setting.  However, Ehcache.getCacheConfiguration().getDiskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds() seems to just return the value from the specific cache.  So, this change could cause you to see a different value for at least this variable.  Haven't experimented with the others, but I'm guessing they are similar. 

We had one test that  was relying on the value set in the default cache and not overriding it.  I had to apply the setting to the test cache as well to get it to show up.

I think the problem I commented on earlier was due to a bug in the code which I've fixed.  Anyhow, tests all seem to be working and I think it's ok now.  

Just for good measure I posted the question on the ehcache forums in case that problem is real.
