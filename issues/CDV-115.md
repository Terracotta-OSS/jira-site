## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We've changed our kit layout and consolidated all 3 products into 1 - it used to be that we have a Welcome script/app that runs for each product --- now that we've consolidated all products we need to update the Welcome script/app so that it presents all of the components of the kit (DSO/Pojos, Sessions, and Springs samples)
