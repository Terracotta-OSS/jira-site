## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The property com.tc.l1.max.connect.retries controls how many times an L1 client tries to connect to the L2 \1after\1 the client has its configuration data, but there is currently no way to limit how many times the L1 tries to get its configuration data when using the "production" configuration-model where the client configuration must be loaded from the server -- the client keeps retrying for 5 minutes and then exits.

It would be nice if com.tc.l1.max.connect.retries or some other property  could be used to control the number of retries when getting configuration data.

just my $0.02 on for the implementor -- if we're going to allow the number of config fetch retries to be configurable, might as well make the delay time configurable too so that the total "hang" time in the event of unavailable remote config source can be deterministic. Either that or just make the total time configurable and leave the delay time hard coded.
