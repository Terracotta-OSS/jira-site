## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Found some errors in the docs:

- The "Multi Page User Guide" page at

http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/

shows different content for the table of contents in
the menu to the left and the main page (to the right).

- The "Single Page User Guide" contains some items
which don't exist in the "Multi Page" guide.

- The "J2EE Servlet Caching" links in both the single-
and multi-page guides go to

http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/j2ee\1servlet\1caching.html

which is a 404.

- The link to "General Purpose Caching" at

http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/getting\1started.html

is wrong (and consequently 404s).


Hope this helps! Keep up the good work!

I try to be good with documentation, because I know it is the most important 
thing for this project now. It is very good to get this type of bug reported. It 
forces me to fix. 

Fixes:
- Created the J2EE Servlet Page.
- Added missing contents to the multi page version.
- Removed the collapsible tab, so that there is one less table of contents to 
get out of date.

I am hoping to improve the documentation to a much better standard over 
time. The introduction is a new chapter I wrote.

BTW  I read your blog. Very nice. I found myself agreeing with you and 
learning stuff. Cool!

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
