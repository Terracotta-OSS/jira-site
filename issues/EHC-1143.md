## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Making a search against an in-memory cache the  
net.sf.ehcache.store.BruteForceSearchManager#executeQuery is not taking into account the element's expiry returning elements that isExpired() method sees as expired.

Cache is configured with eternal=false and timeToIdle/timeToLive have valid values.

Just to understand better what you are describing, can you elaborate your test?

Am I right in reading that you get an \{\{Element\}\} from the search result and then invoke \{\{Element.isExpired()\}\}?

Hi, basically I have cache configured as searcheable for several attributes, when I execute a query against this cache I'm getting expired elements. 
So, as you said, if I issue a element.isExpired() over the returned elements I get True.
Let me know if at least an unit test is needed to understand better.
