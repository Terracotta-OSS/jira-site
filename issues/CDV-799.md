## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since I've grown used to looking for something like this in my output to determine if Terracotta is actually running on the client:

2008-07-01 06:44:23,053 INFO - Terracotta 2.6.0, as of 20080520-120516 (Revision 8595 by cruise@rh4mo0 from 2.6.0)

it is misleading when dso-env prints out that same message, yet doesn't work properly.

This happened to me when I was trying out example2 of Chapter 7 of the Terracotta book.  its instructions are to use dso-env with the -q option which is supposed to set up the proper environment variables in <TOMCAT>/bin/setenv.sh.  However, if that doesn't work properly (which it didn't for me), dso-env prints out the "Terracotta 2.x.y, as of ..." message, misleading me into thinking Terracotta was actually working in the client.

Give better logging so that you know the output is from dso-env, not from terracotta running.
e.g. "This is the dso-env script......"

Fixed in rev 9423.

make-boot-jar will now run in FATAL log level for the console when using dso-java

Running make-boot-jar individually will still give log messages to the console.

Currently (2.7.0-nightly-rev9770) an additional comment "Starting BootJarTool..." is printed to the console output.  This is the only distinction between the two invocations.  Yes, in fact the config file is read twice, once when the boot jar is (re)made, and once again when the app is launched.

Looking only at the console output, this looks a lot like the L1 is double started, and the config file is read twice, when the app is launched.  

I don't think this addresses the spirit of the original request, but it does address the letter of the request.  There is a difference in the output.

I think a better choice might be to change the output when the BootJarTool is launched to look visually different on the console.
