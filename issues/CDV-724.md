## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I was mucking about yesterday and created a named lock (Not something I do often). Anyway I didn't actually give it a name and it let me create it anyway and just created an invalid named lock.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Can create a name lock with default name "Newlock". However, if you delete the name (in DSO lock tab) and then click outside the table, the whole lock will be deleted. After this, you can't add any more name locks (can't select any more aspectwrks expression)

tested with 2.7.2-nightly, r10991
