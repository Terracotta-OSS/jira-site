## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The source of the reference config file is here:

  https://svn.terracotta.org/repo/forge/projects/tim-hibernate-cache/trunk/tim-hibernate-cache-provider-3.2/src/main/resources/org/terracotta/hibernate/reference-config.xml

The build process should get this file from svn every build and should be using the appropriate branch (ie. it cannot always be tc-3.1 as given above). 

It should be a build error if the source doesn't not exist. There should only be one copy of this file in SVN, it should not be duplicated to facilitate the build process.
