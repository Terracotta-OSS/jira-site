## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Shared Queue demo's use of locks is wrong. It mutates data under a certain lock and reads the data without grabbing the same lock. The mail that first pointed this problem is attached below.

==================================================
Hi,
>>
>> We have come across something in the example(Shared Queue) given in 
>> teracotta samples. We observed that in tc-config.xml a write log is 
>> specified for method( Worker.keepAlive() ) cause a new instance is being 
>> created in the method and assigned to the long variable( lastbeat ). But 
>> no lock is specified for the method( Worker.attempKill() ) which 
>> accesses the long variable( lastbeat).
>> According to our understanding there should be read lock specified on 
>> the method( Worker.attempKill() ).
>>
>> Kindly explain this point. Cause we have many getter methods in our root 
>> object and this point needs to be addressed.
>>
>> Does teracotta internally take care of this.
>>
>> Regards,
>> Sachin

Fixed on rev 1293 in the trunk branch.

Named lock with lock-level read on method Worker::expire() (was attemptKill()) - added in tc-config for the sharedqueue demo
