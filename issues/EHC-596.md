## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need to implement a mechanism to catch events occurring in other Terracotta nodes on the clustered store and propagate them as cache events in the local node.  The thinking to date is that the ideal implementation of this would be to watch the logical events occurring on the clustered store map.  The events to watch would be:

put - covers PUT, UPDATE events
remove - covers REMOVE, EXPIRE, EVICTION events
removeAll - covers REMOVEALL event

for the remove varieties (and maybe the put varieties), we might need a way to indicate during the remove the cause for the removal as these are all the same logical event.

</div>

Verified w/ ehcache-dx-sample webapp.

Put, update, remove, removeAll, expire, evict all events are clustered.

tc-clustered ehcache does throws evict event on element expiry tracked by DEV-3841.
