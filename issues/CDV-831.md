This project should be set up as a regular Forge project with release cycle matched with TC release like ehcache and everything else. It's currently not.

I setup the project to look like the rest of the forge but I'm sure the Maven release plugin should have been used to create the branches.  I'll leave it to the Maven mavens to get that right.  The other important piece is changing the Get-SVT page to support the different versions.  And what about when the user installs the wrong version?  The console will need to check for the SVT version it expects.  What a pain.

wrap SVT and manage as a TIM (tim-svt)
Update admin script to look for svt in modules directory
add to tim-get script

Update the website page - to have instructions on running tim-get 

Issues: 
windows scripts

Removed the need to have the scripts mess with classpath, now just determine the correct tim-svt archive and load it dynamically.
Still need a 2.7-specific SVT-Get page.
