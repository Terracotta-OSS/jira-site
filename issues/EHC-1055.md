## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

\{\{CacheManager #createSizeOfEngine\}\} provides a means to use a custom \{\{SizeOfEngine\}\} implementation, falling back to \{\{DefaultSizeOfEngine\}\} if no custom implementation is specified.  However, there are parts of EhCache that ignore this, and directly instantiate a \{\{DefaultSizePolicy\}\} regardless of the custom setting:

\* \{\{LruMemoryStore #getSizeInBytes\}\}
\* \{\{MemoryStore #getInMemorySizeInBytes\}\}

The custom implementation should be used in all cases, and not just inside \{\{CacheManager\}\}.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Linking to duplicate issue for supporting user-defined SizeOf.
However, there are no plans to change the Store methods mentioned. The fact that they rely on the DefaultSizeOfEngine is an implementation detail.
