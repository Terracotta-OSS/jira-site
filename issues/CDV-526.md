## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Allow a user to enable the SO\_KEEPALIVE setting for sockets (L1 and L2) using a tc.property setting.

The default should be false, so the product behaves the same as it does today (follow the settings given by the OS), enabling the tc.property will enable the socket option - thus overriding the OS setting.

Since the default time for keepalive is in hrs and since in linux there is no way to turn on keep alive while the program is running, it wouldnt be too bad to have this value set to true by default.

We have made some changes to enable it, but we have not made a property out of it yet.
