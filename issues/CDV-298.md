## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/247.page#1388

start.sh and the other shell scripts use:
#!/bin/sh

in Unbuntu, it's invoked "dash" shell instead of Bash.

Workaround is to specifically invoke Bash shell with:

#!/bin/bash

And, by default, bash doesn't come with Solaris. If we support Solaris, we should not depend on bash.
