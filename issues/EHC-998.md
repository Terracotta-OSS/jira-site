## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Originally asked at http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/8004.page

ElementResource doesn't return a Content-Type header when I do an HTTP HEAD on a valid Element, but it does when I do a GET, which contradicts what the documentation says.

The reason I need this is that I really don't want to have to download the document's data when sniffing for its type.

Should be trivial to recreate: create Cache, POST some 'application/json' to an element, check that GET returns the Content-Type header, and that HEAD does not.
