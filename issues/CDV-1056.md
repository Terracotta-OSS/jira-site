$ bin/tim-get.sh foo
Terracotta trunk-nightly, as of 20081121-101156 (Revision 10889 by cruise@su10mo5 from trunk)

Unknown command: foo

This is the Terracotta Integration Modules manager.
Below is a list of all the commands that are available.

General syntax:

   tim-get.bat [command] [arguments] {options}

Commands:
      help   Display help information
      info   Display detailed information about an integration module
   install   Install an integration module
      list   List all available integration modules for TC 2.8.0-SNAPSHOT
    update   Update to the latest version of an integration module

Further help:
   Each command accepts a --help option that will display additional
   usage information for the command. Specifying the command name after
   the "help" command does the same thing.

Properties file:
   For most cases there is no need to edit it, but there is a tim-get.properties 
   file in the lib/resources folder that dictates tim-get.bat's
   behavior - read the file for details.
