## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

source: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/3110.page

If a listener instance implements more than 1 of the listener interfaces it will get duplicate in the list of listeners we call events on. 

tomcat-5.0 SessionValve50 and TerracottaPipeline50 probably have the same issue

Is this important to resolve now?

provided it is a real bug it seems reasonable to fix at some time. It's not good to be changing how often listeners get called depending on whether you're using TC clustered sessions or not
