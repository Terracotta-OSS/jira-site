## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

when I selected the server tab I see the disk fault/flush labels, but I am a bit surprised that there is disk fault/flush activity in the l2.  I am just playing with the shared editor here and would not have expected disk flush / fault activity for such a trivial data size.  are these graphs truly disk flush/fault?

Tested with  Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev7833, as of 20080331-190316 (Revision 7833 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.6), it is working as expected.

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample application launcher
3. Launch the sharededitor demo
4. Launch the admin console
5. In the admin console, select the Servers | Runtime statistics

Actual: Object Flush Rate and Object Fault Rate graph labels are displayed
