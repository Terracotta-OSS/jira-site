## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the attached example, the field set in test.B$Sub.mutate(B) is not instrumented. This allows shared objects to read/written w/o DSO knowing about it 

It is expected that this program will generate (and ignore) an UnlockedSharedObjectException, instead you get this:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.AssertionError: mutated without a lock
	at test.Main.main(Main.java:14)

Subclasses of logical structures are flacky as a whole. We should at some point look into it.
