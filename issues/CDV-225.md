I suppose it would make more sense for me to take ownership of this.

Just for me to know, what is understood by 'supporting' a framework. As it is currently, together with Jonas and the help afterwards from Juris, trunk should have proper support for RIFE. There are no tests inside Terracotta for it though, but Steve told me that I could spend some time on that this week.

That's already done afaik, it's in trunk. I'll be working now on adding a series of tests for RIFE support to the TC test suite and I'll try out all examples and applications I can get my hands on.
