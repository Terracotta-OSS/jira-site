## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment, boot jar classes must be explicitly listed, one by one. It could be convenient to express boot jar includes with a pattern such as java.blah.\1. Patterns would increase boot jar creation time since all of boot classpath (ie. all of the standard boot jars) would have to be searched to see if the pattern matches. Boot jar validation would also need to be considered when adding pattern support here.

NOTE: Please read mine and Saravanan's comments below. This item probably isn't a good idea :-)

man, where did I come up with these crazy ideas. Some caution would be appropriate here, seems too easy to get yourself into bad situations with boot jar patterns. They could be handy, but also maybe too dangerous for most users. We've seen a good number of things where too much instrumentation in the boot jar causes problems (either with bootstrapping the VM, or just regular performance issues). Patterns would increase the likelihood of these issues IMO

I agree with Tim, on his comment that is, not on the original report :p

We need to think about exactly what we want before doing it.

this is not related to search :-) 

this is DSO only and can be moved/closed.
