## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Seems like there is a corner case when the client-reconnect-window  (default of 2 minutes) is not honored in the Network A/P configuration. 

See http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/667.page

This snippet from Terracotta Server log reveals the bug or is at best confusing - 
1> It shows the Election being won by this server at 14:48 (and therefore the clock starts ticking then) and the expecation is that 14:50 is when the client-reconnect-window closes. 
2> But it instead closes at 14:54...Is this because, there is a lot more work happening before the server is actually Active - so that the timer only started at 14:52.

The reconnect window in fact got closed in 2 minutes. If you look closely at the logs there is this line.

The cleanups completes at a later point in time. My guess is because of the network glitch the cleanup took a longer time to complete.
