## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Part of fixing this should be to update the tools documentation on how to use dso-env.sh.

http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/docdraft/Terracotta+Tools#TerracottaTools-TerracottaDSOEnvironmentTool

Also the documentation listed here:

http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/docdraft/Terracotta+Sessions+Web+Cluster+Setup+Guides

AND, either patching 2.3 (which I doubt will happen) or fixing the docs here:

http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/docs23/Terracotta+Tools#TerracottaTools-TerracottaDSOEnvironmentTool

and here:
