## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

While attempting to nail down details on CDV-1527, I asked another developer on my project team to try running Terracotta using the latest JDK on his computer. When he launched the server from Eclipse, Eclipse would hang, as though the plugin was still in the process of launching the server even though the console indicated that the server had started as an active node and was ready for work. His only recourse was to manually kill Eclipse and all of the other Java processes, including the Terracotta server. We were not able to find any workaround.

His system is running 64-bit Ubuntu 10.04 with Terracotta Server and Eclipse plugin version 3.4.0. We tried changing the JRE System Library in the project to JDK 6u16, 6u21, and 6u22, in case this problem was related to CDV-1527, but doing so had no impact.

Could you get a thread dump of the server process while it hangs?

Since the problem doesn't occur on my system, I've asked the other developer to register an account here so he can answer your questions directly.

sorry for the confusion, but I think (multiple) thread dumps of eclipse (when it is "hung") would be the useful diagnostic here. 

Could you also mention the version of eclipse you're running?

Do we have any Ubuntu box (VMware??) in house to reproduce it since we haven't heard from the original poster?
