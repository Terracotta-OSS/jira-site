http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/ehcache-constructs/documentation/
which is supposed to be the ehcache-constructs
documentation is, instead, a copy of the ehcache
documentation.

Fixed. 

Somehow my CVS/Repository for this file ended up pointing to the 
ehcache one even though they are in different CVS modules. I must have 
copied a directory over at some point.
