## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Not sure if this necessary needs to work, but it should perhaps fail in a different way. It has been reported that declaring something like java.lang.Boolean.TRUE as a root produces errors like:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: java.lang.Boolean.\_\_tc\_getTRUE()Ljava/lang/Boolean;
    at tctest.TcTest.<clinit>(TcTest.java:4)

The client code is trying to call a root getter synthetic method but alas it does not exist


NOTE: This might work if java.lang.Boolean is listed in <additional-bootjar-classes>

moving to 3.1.x at least (since it was sitting in 3.0.x)
