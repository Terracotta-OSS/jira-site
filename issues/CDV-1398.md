## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If a region-name contains any trailing spaces in the tc-hibernate-cache.xml config file (ie: before the closing </region-name> tag), the spaces are considered verbatim.

I would have expected prefix'ing and trailing spaces to be ignored by the xml parser.

For example, I would have expected
<region-name>My.Region</region-name>

to be the same as 
<region-name>My.Region
</region-name>

This is obviously a trivial thing to fix, but just to muddy the waters slightly I thought I had better ask this first:

As far as I can tell from the source code Hibernate does not ever trim the text in the mapping xml.  This means that in principle you can define an entity to use a cache whose name has whitespace in it.  Sounds crazy I know.  Do we want to implement this, and then prevent those people from using us without changing their cache names?

I've modified the xpath expression that matches against the region name text to normalize the whitespace of the text before attempting the match.  This will trim the leading and trailing whitespace, and collapse internal whitespace sequences to a single space character.  I also added a test to XMLConfigurationTest.
