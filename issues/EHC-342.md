## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The attached patch allows ehcache to compile against
java 1.4. As can be seen, the changes are trivial. 

While some intent is lost in the change from Queue to
List, I think it is worth it to maintain 1.4
compatibility; unless of course that is not required
any longer for ehcache.

There were a couple of instances where the new static
parseBoolean method was used. I changed these to
Boolean.valueOf().booleanValue(). While this is
slightly more verbose, there is no increase in the
number of objects created as the static Boolean.FALSE
and Boolean.TRUE constants are used (on Sun's VM at least).
