## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I added a config module that specified locks on SynchronizedCollection - there was no indication that I needed to re-create my boot-jar. 

As part of removing boot-jar pain, we need to consider how to detect when or if a boot-jar must be re-created - or at least give config modules the ability to hint that adding them may require a re-build.

I have a thought.  From the final configuration, generate a canonical version of the xml file - this is something that is generally done as the first step in signing an xml document so it should be available in the java platform.

take the output of the canonical xml file and hash it - then store this hash in the generated boot-jar manifest.

Upon start-up, do this process every time - if the boot-jar manifest does not match the xml hash, then you need to re-build the boot jar.
