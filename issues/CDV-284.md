## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

1. See log snippet below.

2. Inspite of all debugging being turned on, there was no message indicating why the disconnect occurred - so there should be some more visiblity

3. The issue was eventually traced back to starting tomcat from a controller process jsvc http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/daemon/jsvc.html. Stating Tomcat via catalina.sh without a controlling process worked around this issue. We should investigate this since starting a dameon process with jsvc appears to non-trivially prevalent.

Thanks.

this is probably the same issue we had with JBoss' tomcat. In all branches except trunk(Moraga), there was instrumentation that shut down the DSO client when a particular method  org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start() returned. That method has two contexts that is can be called in -- a blocking and a non-blocking version. JBoss (and presumably tomcat under jsvc) use the non-blocking version, and thus the DSO client shuts down as soon as tomcat starts

I'll be addressing this in Moraga. 

It would be great if a trunk build could be tested with tomcat+JSvc and the results posted here

looks like this is fixed in trunk (which will be Moraga(2.3.0)). I tested a tomcat running under jsvc. The DSO client disconnects as described when I run it with 2.2.1, and running with trunk it stays connected.
