## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Taking a bigger view than EHC-535, there are a bunch of places where classloading happens in Ehcache:
- Configuration factory classes (almost always classes included in Ehcache, so not too big a deal).  This code uses some of the stuff in ClassLoaderUtil
- TerracottaStoreHelper loading the StoreFactory for either express or custom mode - uses more stuff in ClassLoaderUtil
- Deserializing objects in DiskStore - this uses a custom object stream that utilizes the TCCL.  
- Deserializing objects in a ClusteredStore

These all use slightly different classloading strategies.  Would be nice to consolidate these into something consistent and user configurable.  Also might be nice to allow users to associate a classloader with a Cache or CacheManager that would be used for deserialization from disk or clustered stores.

Important for some customers to do some more research on how this would best work in osgi.

The rather inconsistent and clunky way it is now works. It arrived at this state after a lot of bug reports. 

Before closing this JIRA we should review ( I guess with a text search) the old Sourceforge.net bug reports and make sure we don't break something that is not broken now.

Believe this was resolved in 1.7.2
