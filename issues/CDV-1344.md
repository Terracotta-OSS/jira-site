## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

iterator() on the aforementioned class uses an anonymous inner class. We are not currently instrumenting that type and it can perform a naked field read on its enclosing instance of java.util.Collections$UnmodifiableCollection. 

CollectionsWrappersTest can be updated to cover this case quite easily.

A quick glance at the other wrapper implementations in java.util.Collections shows that the same issue might exist for other types as well (eg. UnmodifiableList, etc)
