## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In supporting the 1.5 IBM JDK as a client runtime option, several backward steps were taken to ensure that things worked although not necessarily as efficiently as for Sun which has been tuned in many instances.  This is to be a high-level issue that captures all of the little things we need to do to make sure performance is up to the same level as with the Sun JDK, and that certain corner cases are re-factored or otherwise handled properly.
