## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I am using only the memory story (no disk and no off-heap), but there are different values in statistics "cache misses" and "in memory misses". I don't know which one is correct.

CacheMisses: 75977
CacheHits: 38151

InMemoryCacheMisses: 4843
InMemoryCacheHits: 38151

Note: all other statistics are zeroes, and ObjectCount = InMemoryObjectCount
