## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The current "spec" (the javadoc) for manual lock management defines the eviction of a unpinned lock as a no-op.  For the ConcurrentDistributedMap this means that remove operations on previously non-local keys do not evict (and therefore recall) the associated key lock (as the lock will not be pinned as it is not local on entry to the method).  The fix to change this behavior is a one-liner in the ClientLock class.

What problem are we trying to solve?
Is it necessary for 3.1?

As of the moment I have no proof that this is a bottleneck.  I filed this simply to make sure that the "bug"s existence was recorded.  If we find it to be a bottleneck then I will obviously post a comment here.

thanks Chris. I'll move out to Santiago, if we find it is an issue we will move it back to Rivera

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I'm closing this since the evictLock method no longer exists in the new lock implementation, and as it was never shown to be a bottleneck in CSM (the only code that I know of that uses it) I'm reluctant to rock the 3.1 boat in order to fix it.
