## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hello,

While using the GZipFilter in v1.3.0 (I think it also applies to v1.4.0), I think the response wrapper setHeader should not by default add the header but rather override the header if it exists, I believe the std indicates as such. 

If the header already exists and would like to change the value of it, like the Content-Disposition header, the setHeader adds a new entry for the header rather than change the value of it.

Thanks for your consideretion.

I cannot think why I did that originally. We have been using this for four years!

Have made the change. 

    /**
     * Set the headers in the response object, excluding the Gzip header
     *
     * @param pageInfo
     * @param requestAcceptsGzipEncoding
     * @param response
     */
    protected void setHeaders(final PageInfo pageInfo,
                              boolean requestAcceptsGzipEncoding,
                              final HttpServletResponse response) {

        final Collection headers = pageInfo.getHeaders();
        final int header = 0;
        final int value = 1;

        for (Iterator iterator = headers.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
            final String[] headerPair = (String[]) iterator.next();
            response.setHeader(headerPair[header], headerPair[value]);
        }
    }

All the tests seem to pass against Orion and Tomcat, so I guess it is ok.

This is in trunk and will be in ehcache 1.5 Thanks for your patch.
