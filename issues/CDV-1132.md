## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When admin console launches SVT, you just get a giant gray pane with 2 buttons labeled "import" and "retrieve" at the top left.  Nothing is broken but yetI suggest the following feature request:

Display an HTML page explaining how to get stats that can be imported or retrieved for this tool.  Example...

To use the SVT, you must have run the ClusterStatsRecorder and either exported the results or have a running L2 at which you can now point.
Use IMPORT to pull in an earlier EXPORTed data set from your TC array
Use RETRIVE to connect to your running array and retrieve a recorded session either in-progress or previously run.  The array and the SVT will agree on available sessions to retrieve dynamically.  

Give it a try now :)

Just a thought because I am working with a user who I think is confused by this UE.
