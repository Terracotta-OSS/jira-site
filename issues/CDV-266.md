## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

A number of people have done \*.\* type locking and effected their performance by autolocking in unexpected ways. I think this could be solved by not locking things in the bootjar unless the lock config is in the bootjar section.

To be clear, I think the thing here is to add some new element(s) to the config schema that make the locking that should apply to boot jar classes. I don't know if anyone has actually specified how the elements should actually be structured, but the bottom line is that the existing lock elements should not be applied when creating the boot jar
