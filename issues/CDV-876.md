## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When the number of object flushes gets large, the number is truncated on the left - see attached screen shot.

One possibility would be to switch to using 'k' instead of 000, as we do for 'M' in at least some of the other metrics.

</div>

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.2, as of 20081209-151238 (Revision 11005 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), observed the "object flush rate" graph for the LRT test, when the number of object flushes gets large, the y-axis number is truncated to "k" instead of "000" as expected. (refer the expected snap shot)
