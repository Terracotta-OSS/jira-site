## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At least for things like java.lang.Boolean you should be able to write code that does reference equality checks with the Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE constants. This currently doesn't work since we call "new Boolean()" when creating field values of type Boolean.
