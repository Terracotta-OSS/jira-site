## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

when i try to deploy a Portal application on a bea weblogic server (9.2.1), that is enabled for terracotta (added the java startup arguments to the bea server and the client is visible in the Terracotta Administrator Console), the deployment fails and a lot of compile errors are shown concerning bea classes (from netuix.jar and content.jar, see attached log file). for some reason bea wants to compile these classes on deployment.

Can you take a look at this and see if it is a simple solution?

I'll have a look at the sample application -- thanks for attaching that. 

In the meantime, I believe you can avoid this issue by tweaking the instrumented-classes section of tc-config.xml. Specifically you want to at least <exclude> these com.bea..\* classes. I'm assuming that your tc-config.xml has an <include> pattern of \*..\* at the moment, so another approach would be to just include the types you know will be joining your distributed object graphs

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

adding this to the end of your <instrumented-classes> should get past this issue -- although a proper fix will still be made the terracotta product

<exclude>com.bea..\*</exclude>

a fix has been committed to trunk/2.5.x -- the workarouind above will suffice for 2.4.x
