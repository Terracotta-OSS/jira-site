## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It's been documented (see below) how the java.io.tmpdir
is inconsistent with regards to the trailing separator
depending upon the platform.

On Windows, you get something like C:\temp\. On Mac OSx
and other Linux platforms, you get something like /tmp. 

On one platform, there is a trailing separator. On the
other, no. 

When we attempt to define an ehcache.xml that works on
both Linux and Windows, and we're unable to. That's
because the trailing slash isn't looked for.

On Windows, the definition would need to look like this:

<diskStore path="java.io.tmpdirpentaho"/> 

On Linux, the definition would need to look like this:

<diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir/pentaho"/> 

Unfortunately, adding the '/' on Windows fails.

Thanks for your consideration on this bug,

Fixed.

See DiskStoreTest#testWindowsAndSolarisTempDirProblem and 
DiskStoreConfiguration. 

This is in trunk and will be in ehcache-1.2.4.
