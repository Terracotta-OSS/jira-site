## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At the moment tim-resin does not provide any clustered sessions support. The beginnings of that work is present in the code, but it is commented out since many tests are failing and DEV-3441. 

NOTE: The pom for tim-resin-system-tests only runs DsoRootTest. When session support is added, this exclusion should be removed from the pom so that all the container tests run

One slightly bad thing is that there is no indication that you won't get clustered sessions when using tim-resin, they just won't be clustered
