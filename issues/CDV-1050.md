## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If JAVA\1HOME is missing from the system environment than dso-java fails with a meaningless message:

Can we do the following
1. Check to see if JAVA\1HOME is valid
2. Give a clear error message.

The following is an exchange between Juris, TimEck, and Alex Miller regarding the issue (most recent response at the top):

Well, I think I would update the jira with the JAVA\1HOME stuff and also the suggested likely problem of java main class being compiled with a different jdk.  It's probably worth trying that scenario to see if you can duplicate the error.  If so, I'd recommend we close as "won't fix".

I think is spot-on.

BTW, we do throw an error is JAVA\1HOME is not set, here's a couple of examples of what happens:

> ./start-demo-server.sh
/Users/jgalang/Code/Terracotta/dso/2.7/code/base/build/dist/terracotta-2.7.3-snapshot/samples/../bin/start-tc-server.sh: the JAVA\1HOME environment variable is not defined correctly

> ./bin/dso-env.sh
./bin/dso-env.sh: the JAVA\1HOME environment variable is not defined correctly

I wonder if the user somehow has JAVA\1HOME defined and is simply overwriting it with the appropriate version.

Sounds good. If one of you can find them and link them, that would be
good.

What do you think about my assessment of the actual problem the user was
experiencing?

There are (I think) some separate jiras regarding JAVA\1HOME in our
scripts.  If it is required, and you haven't set it, then we should
throw an error message.

I had some thoughts on this, but after reading the bug again, I'm
not sure
this is our problem really. I think maybe his java main class was
built
with a later VM than the he was running with. It's not our place to
try to
make that any friendlier (the same thing would happen w/o TC).

Do we require JAVA\1HOME to be defined for us in our scripts? That
might
already be the case, I'm not sure though.

The person filing the bug seems to think he gets that error iff
JAVA\1HOME
isn't defined. Does that add up?

No idea yet what to do with it - if you've got suggestions please
comment on the JIRA.

do? thx

The error is because the user was likely using an older VM version. The JAVA\1HOME is probably always set - it was just being overwritten with the path to the appropriate VM version.

To recreate:
0. Set JAVA\1HOME to point to a 1.5 or 1.6 installation.
1. Download the kit (or checkout and do a ./tcbuild dist)
2. Go to the sample/ directory of the kit.
3. do ./start-demo-server.sh --- and the server will start.
4. Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.
5. Now set JAVA\1HOME to point to a 1.4 insallation.
6. You will need to edit bin/start-tc-server.sh -- remove or comment out the following piece of code 
(it's a 1.5+ only VM arg - it has no bearing on the current issue):

   -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError 

7. Now do: ./start-demo-server.sh --- and the server wont start, and the VM will spit out the ff message:

> ./start-demo-server.sh
