## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Am not sure if there is a JIRA around this although recall discussing it earlier.

Wherever possible, runtime config modifications need to be allowed - especially those that do not impact the semantic meaning of the applicaiton (i.e. do not modify roots, transients, on-loads etc.)
- Debug Logging levels 
- a new standby 
etc...

Today, in the typical deployment, even a minor change (e.g. turning on debug logging) requires:
1. Modifyication of the config,
2. Restarting the Terracotta servers
3. Restarting the clients appservers.
