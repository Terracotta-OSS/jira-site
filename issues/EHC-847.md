## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Because Ehcache does not provide access to the user.name property when setting up the DiskStore path, it is not possible to vary the location of the cache in java.io.tmpdir on UNIX platforms.  This is a problem because the first user running Ehcache gets a directory created in tmp that has permissions set for that user.  If another user then runs the same application, they do not have access to the cache in tmp because they don't have permission to do so.  

This is not a problem on Windows because the value of java.io.tmpdir varies based on the user, in contrast tmp on UNIX is the same area for all users.

It would be possible to setup a DiskStore path and point to "user.home" and solve this problem, but of course writing to tmp is more desireable.

The ability to do <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir/user.name/myappdir"/> would solve this issue.

Can you comment on what you think about this? (no fixing or doing:)

Although this particular problem can be worked around at both the OS and JVM levels, this does seem like a reasonable request - while we're at it we may as well just do full-on property substitution, something like the following should suffice:

```
private static final Pattern PROPERTY_SUBSTITUTION_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("\\$\\{(.+?)\\}");

private static String substituteProperties(String string) {
    Matcher matcher = PROPERTY_SUBSTITUTION_PATTERN.matcher(string);

    StringBuffer eval = new StringBuffer();
    while (matcher.find()) {
        String substitution = System.getProperty(matcher.group(1));
        if (substitution != null) {
            matcher.appendReplacement(eval, Matcher.quoteReplacement(substitution));
        }
    }
    matcher.appendTail(eval);

    return eval.toString();
}
```

Incidentally, embedded in the proposed code above is an implied deprecation of the syntax:

```
<diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir/user.name/myappdir"/>
```


The new substitution form would be:

```
<diskStore path="${java.io.tmpdir}/${user.name}/myappdir"/>
```


We would still support the existing old-format substitutions, but not arbitrary property substitution of using the old syntax.

Assigning back to DRB to review Chris' comments

I've added the ability to do arbitrary property substitution using tokens like "$\{property-name\}".  Support for the four existing substitutions is still in place.
