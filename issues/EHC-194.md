## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi, I'm Stefano and before of all compliments!! Great Work!!

I'm using last ehcache 1.4.0

Sometimes, when I stop tomcat in development environment ( Netbeans 5.5 and tomcat 5.5.15 ), I have a "looping" error..... the same error is repeated many times!

The only way to exit from this situation is kill tomcat process. Normally (for me) tomcat process memory was 50MB.... in this case increase at 80, 100, 120...

In attachemnet you have standard output for tomcat and ehcache.xml.

....emh... in ehcache.xml I don't change nothing.... may be this?!?

Probably this is only a "my problem"..... in this case I'm sorry for your lost time!!

Bye, Stefano.
