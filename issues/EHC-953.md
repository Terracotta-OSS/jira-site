## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently DefaultSizeOfEngine cannot be easily extended in order to make simple changes, such as adding a custom user filter or a specific SizeOf implementation.

I have provided a patch that refactors this class to make it a bit easier to customize the SizeOfEngine behavior without having to write one from scratch.

Need to carefully review if his approach (protected method to override the default sizeOf) is suitable or not... Just quickly glanced at the patch

Can you verify that this is even something we would want to do?
