## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

clustered-hibernate-3.2.5 has an incorrect dependency spec  for clustered-cglib, it is missing the version.  

From Antonio:
I just looked at the the manifest file of clustered-hibernate-3.2.5 from
the 2.5.1 branch. It does has a dependency on cglib-2.1.3, but it is
missing the "bundle-version:=" information. Is this causing the problem?
