## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There is no way to pause the scrolling server logs in admin client. It will be nice if the scrolling stopped if the user scrolled up to look at some log.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.2, as of 20081209-151238 (Revision 11005 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), the scrolling is stopped at the desired place while viewing the server log in the admin console, working as expected.
