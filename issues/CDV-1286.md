## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/2179.page
pius is running into CDV-232 which is currently under review with Glassfish engineers and Terracotta.  This is a logging issue and should not affect running Terracotta and Glassfish.
But also seeing a problem with the glassfish admin console showing a blank page, web application root is also showing a blank page.

I Tried this setup in Windows XP with Java 1.6.0\_13 with Terracotta 3.0.1.  I am able to reproduce this.

Admin page(localhost:4848) is not coming in presence of Terracotta. But I am able to access localhost:8080.

I reproduced this too. I don't know what is really going wrong, but I do know that we don't (yet) claim to support glassfish v2.1. We support v1 and v2 (v2.1 is different than v2)

assigning this back to DRB. This is really a question about when we want to add glassfish v2.1 support, not a bug with our existing support

Send email to Nitin to see if customer using Glassfish saw this issue as well...on V2

Assigning to PM. Decide if we want to support this version of Glassfish. Currently V2 is tested and certified. Not V2.1
