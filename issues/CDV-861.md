## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Make Eclipse plugin support multiple DSO projects.  e.g.,, have the plugin assemble tc-config.xml "fragments" from each project to be contributed to the final runtime of the DSO application/launch.  Or maybe even have the plugin generate a TIM configuration?

Original discussion [for this feature request] is at http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/728.page#8085

Workaround (?):
---------------

Replicate tc-config.xml to be the same across all opened projects.  Such file would need to be union of the Terracotta configuration for each project.
