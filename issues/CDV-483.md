I suppose I'm not the one to decide, but I think we could either add more info the exception message (as the title suggests), but another option is that if the NPE wasn't thrown from some \1\1tc\1xxx method, we could probably just leave it as is. Since it comes from some strange TC method, it is easy to think it is our fault.
