## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is failing in ConcurrentHashMapLoadTest in 2.2.1. Because the implementation of the ConcurrentHashMap.size() and empty() methods do not have the same memory barrier as the remove() method, it may not wait until the applicator has finished applying ; thus returning the wrong results and failing the assertion.

Attached: log file of the test.
