## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In net.sf.ehcache.transaction.xa.XATransactionStore#assertNotTimedOut Timeout timestamp is spreaded to all operations in current transaction. However, timeout value is configured strictly via ehcache configuration. Why not just take timeout value from transaction? What is even the point of overriding transaction timeout with own timeout? It causes many problem in cases where long transactions are usual for the server.
The best way to resolve this, i think, is to make ehcache timeout value to be taken from transaction by default and leave the ability to configure different value.
Thank you!
