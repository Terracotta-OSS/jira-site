## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It would be cool to have cache config default templates for basic cache data characteristics (e.g., read-only, read-mostly, read-write).

I'm thinking of something like:

DistributedCache cache = new DistributedCacheBuilder().newReadMostlyCache();

or 

cache = new DistributedCacheBuilder().newReadWriteCache();

I'm not sure this is perfect interface, but something like this would give people pre-set starting points for config values like TTI, TTL for various pre-defined use-cases.

A companion feature would be template configs for Terracotta server and L1 settings based for these templates.
