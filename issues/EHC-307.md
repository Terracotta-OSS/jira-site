## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I created a servlet filter that is aware of the HTTP caching headers that extends Ehcache's SimplePageCachingFilter. It currently supports ETags, Expires, If-Modified-Since, and Last-Modified, and If-None-Match. I think having this filter in the Ehcache distribution would greatly improve the utility of Ehcache's caching servlet filters, and help a lot of your users improve performance.

The code can be found at http://candrews.integralblue.com/2009/02/http-caching-header-aware-servlet-filter/

I really hope this can make it into a future version of Ehcache - thanks!

Applied. Thanks for you thoughtful bug reporting and patches. This improves things for everyone and is the way open source is supposed to work.

This has been released in ehcache-web-1.6
