## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

One of the user of terracotta asking a question on forum that  can he set terracotta client names as their system hostname so that he can see clientname on dev-console?
As per my best understanding, there is no such option as of now.
Actually user is looking cleints on dev-console and he want see clients 
hostname is stead of IP address in dev-console to easily identify the clients.

Below is the link of forum thread:
