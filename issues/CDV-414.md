## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We need to provide some automation to the forge projects to automatically deploy artifacts to a Maven repository, and to automatically generate the web site for the project.  We will be using Maven to provide this automation, so only projects that have a Maven POM can be automated this way.

See attachment for overview.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

We now have a Forge project in JIRA for tracking individual issues, so this umbrella issue is no longer useful.
