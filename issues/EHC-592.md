## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

JMSCacheManagerPeerProviderFactory tries to retrieve the QueueConnectionFactory defined by property getQueueConnectionFactoryBindingName and open a connection to the queue defined by getQueueBindingName even though this queue is not needed for a cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory.

However, the queue is needed for a cacheEventListenerFactory.

Have resolved for my use case, but need to fix it to work with cacheEventListenerFactory. Will submit a patch as soon as I can. :)
