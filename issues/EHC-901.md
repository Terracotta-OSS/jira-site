## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

FrontEndCacheTier always returns the authority's keySet, but neglects that a higher tier might be pinned and might contain more keys than the authority.
I expect DiskStore to also suffer from this when the cache is Pinned to localHeap or localMemory

Fixed in trunk... or so I hope! 
Haven't yet merged back to 2.5, I think we miss the proper branching for offheap-store. Trying to figure this out...
