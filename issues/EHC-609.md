## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

 write you because I'm not able to add the Issue to your
JIRA. I registered and validated an account at Terracotta,
but I'm not able to log into the JIRA.

I have a serious problem with distributed EHCache via
JGroups. My problem is with bootstrapping of distributed
EHCache with JGroups. I'm using JGroups 2.8, EHCache core
1.7.2 and ehcache-jgroupsreplication 1.3. In JGroups 2.8,
the default implementation of Address was changed from
IpAddress to org.jgroups.util.UUID which causes the JGroups
Bootstrapper to fail with a ClassCastException where it
tries to cast a UUID to an IpAddress without any instanceof
checks.

For now I have to try to switch to RMI for Bootstrapping. Do
I only have to set the bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory for this,
or do I need anything else like a
cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory what I don't need for
JGroups replication and bootstrapping?

Downgrading to JGroups 2.7 fixes the issue.

JGroups replication has been rewritten as of 30 August 2010 and the version of JGroups updated to the latest version.

This issue is therefore moot.

You will need to get jgroups replication out of trunk or wait for the release of ehcache-jgroupsreplication 1.4, expected in October 2010.
