## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

1) Start server
2) Start admin console
3) Click on cluster object browser
4) Start a client (which will create a root)

Expected behavior:
See the root (and live object count change)

To workaround:
5) click on another selection (e.g. DGC)
6) click back to admin console  (note live object count and root is now visible)

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.1-nightly, as of 20081030-161014 (Revision 10718 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), cluster objects detects the new roots as expected, but live object count is not changed.

Steps:
1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample application launcher
3. Launch the admin console
4. click on cluster objects (0 roots is displayed) 
5. In the right pane, Live object count: 0 is displayed
6. Launch the shared editor demo from the sample application launcher

Expected: cluster objects should detects the new root and live object count should change when client is started.
Actual: cluster objects detects the new root ie., Cluster objects (1 root) is displayed in the admin console.
But Live object count is still 0

8. click on cluster objects

Actual: now live object count is changed (not working as expected)
