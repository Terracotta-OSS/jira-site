## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The document at http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/docs/Annotations+for+DSO
states that annotations require a Terracotta Integration Module (TIM) but in fact this TIM is no longer used. Currently the way to implement annotations is through the Terracotta Toolkit.
