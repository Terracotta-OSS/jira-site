## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The thread that tries to register MBeans in 1.5+ and register the Terracotta L1 MBeans fails with a ClassNotFoundException when the 'javax.management.builder.initial' system property is set, since it has the Terracotta classloader and not the application/container classloader.  If the application does not create the platform default MBeanServer during initialization time, it may require us to push a little bit, and include in the instrumentation a call from the container/app to ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer().

This is the case (at a minimum) for WebSphere 6.1.0.7 and JBoss 4.0.5 and should at least be fixed in these two containers.

Fixed for WebSphere 6.1.0.7 in 2.4-stable1 and trunk (Ortega).  Moving to JBoss...

I can't reproduce this with our container tests using JBoss.  That said, I don't know much about JBoss and how it works, only that it's very compartmentalized and it's very possible our test doesn't trigger the problem.  However the fix is in for WebSphere, so until we have a definite way to reproduce this in JBoss (again, assuming it's even a problem) I will close this issue.
