That particular thread dump operation uses some internal only thread dump utils that aren't part of the shipping product. If nothing relies on that operation being there we can just remove it. If something does we should maybe move the operation someplace else. 

The code it wants to invoke is that thread dumping that use JNI to determine the PID and sends a kill -3 to itself.

P.s. Use the doServerDump() operations as workaround.
