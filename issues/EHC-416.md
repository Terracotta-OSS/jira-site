## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In 1.3/4 identity mode, you have:   
Element --> VALUE

In 1.7 identity mode, you have:  
DefaultTimestampedValue -->  ElementData --> VALUE

The DefaultTimestampedValue is the Distributed cache element / timeout object (which in serialization mode holds the raw serialized data).   In identity mode, the ElementData is the holder for the guts of the Element data that we actually cluster.  Conceptually seems like these could be combined.  I'm not sure whether there are any dependency/classloader issues with that.  DTV comes from tim-distributed-cache which in dso mode is loaded from the classpath tim.  ElementData is loaded from ehcache jar, also in classpath.

Seems like maybe the clustered ElementData could be a subclass of DefaultTimestampedValue?

Ran 25K owners read-only ehcache perf test, with fix it had around 791K live objects while without it had 1091K live objects. The test creates 25K \* 12 = 3M objects. (Attached Screenshots.)

Read only test with 25k owners. Probably the improvement is not too much as its a read only test which has full data in L1 heap. This should affect the faulting/flushing.
