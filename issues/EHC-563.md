## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

See method processRmiUrls(final String rmiUrls) in MulticastKeepaliveHeartBeatReceiver.
Even though rmiUrlsProcessingQueue is created using Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet()), compound operation is not thread-safe (put-if-absent). Don't think this is a big issue though, at worst two threads (from the thread-pool) will process the same rmiUrls token.
