## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

make the control of these properties something that can be set once in the config of the server, such that the probes can pick them up from there.

current properties are:
ehcachedx.sampling.seconds defaults to 10
ehcachedx.sampling.history defaults to 5
ehcachedx.connection.timeout.seconds defaults to 30

</div>

Technically this can be done but the risk is rather high since it means I have to change the entire probe startup sequence. Currently the properties are read at the instantiation of the cache listener and before it starts up all the sampling counters are created. To be able to set this through the server I have to switch around this whole initialization sequence so that it first waits to connect to a server before even creating the sampling counters. Do you want me to do such changes at this point in the product release phase?
