## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm using ehcache v1.2.2 in a web application that runs
in a tomcat server. 

The tomcat is installed in the default location for a
windows machine (C:\Program Files\Apache Software
Foundation\Tomcat 5.5).

EHCache sends an error that I think has some to do with
the spaces in the server path:

net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: Problem starting
listener for RMICachePeer //10.0.3.4:3658/CacheLevel2.
Initial cause was RemoteException occurred in server
thread; nested exception is: 
 java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling
arguments; nested exception is: 
 java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: Files/Apache


My configuration doesn't refers the server path:

<cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory
           
class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerProviderFactory"
            properties="peerDiscovery=automatic,
                        multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1,
                        multicastGroupPort=4446"/>

<cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory
       
class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory"
        />

Hi

This issue occurs to any RMI listener started on Tomcat. It is either a Tomcat 
or a JDK bug. See http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?
A2=ind0205&L=rmi-users&P=797 and http://www.ontotext.com/kim/doc/
sys-doc/faq-howto-bugs/known-bugs.html.

I cannot fix this but I can add some notes in the documentation and the FAQ 
so that others are not caught out. 

The workaround is to remove the spaces in your tomcat installation path.
