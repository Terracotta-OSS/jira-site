<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The maven-help-plugin already provides this functionality for all plugins, although it is a little verbose:

$ mvn help:describe -Dplugin=org.terracotta.maven.plugins:tc-maven-plugin

This will display all of the available goals for the tc-maven-plugin along with a brief description of each.


</div>

Usage:

If you're under a maven project that configured tc-maven-plugin in the pom.xml, you can do (ie.: tc-maven-plugin/trunk/examples/tc-maven-plugin-sample)

%> mvn tc:help                        # print help for all goals
%> mvn tc:help -Dgoal=run  # print help for goal "run" of tc:run

</div>
