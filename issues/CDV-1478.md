## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently we get following exception if we have <terracottaConfig url="localhost:9510"/>


```
net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: The ehcache configuration specified Terracotta configuration information, but when using the full install of Terracotta, you must specify the Terracotta configuration only with an external tc-config.xml file, not embedded or referenced from the ehcache configuration file.
```


It should be ignored if the app is running custom mode as we do in quartz

```
[INFO] [cargo] 2010-05-14 12:07:03,606 WARN [org.terracotta.quartz.TerracottaJobStore] main - tcConfigUrl property ignored for non-express usage
```


We need to create diff copies of same ehcache config to make it work for custom and express mode in same app.

Well we should probably do things consistently accross express usages of things (ehcache, quartz, etc). The fact that quartz does one thing and ehcache another is odd. I'm sure I'm the one who made quartz the way it is but I don't remember if it had to be that way for any strong technical reason

I imagine you'll find differing opinions on the matter if you ask enough people. If it is a warning then it can be more convenient for testing, but it can also be misleading if you assume the given config will be used. Making it an error forces people to clean up their config

I am in favor this failure message. Without this failure people might think they are running express while they are not. This message makes it clear and forces people to make any adaptation to their ehcache usage strategy if needed

I quite in favor of the hard failure message also. I don't like stale config to linger around config files because it's running in another mode. Choosing custom or express is a conscious choice that should be made.

Throw an exception in Quartz and sessions if they run into this
