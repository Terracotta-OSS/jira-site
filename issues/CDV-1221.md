It isn't obvious, but there is an uninstrumented array access in that test program and config. If you add         <include>java.util.PriorityQueue$Itr</include> to  <additional-boot-jar-classes> things will work. That inner class does array access on the queue in the enclosing instance

I think we should just add official support for this and include these in the boot jar for 3.0.1.  Any reason not to?
