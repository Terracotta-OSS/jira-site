## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think you can actually use MemoryMXBean.setVerbose() to turn on verbose gc at runtime - would be a nice feature for tuning.

Probably good to link this to our GC panel ideas

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Verified with Terracotta 3.2.0-nightly, as of 20091207-081213 (Revision 14149 by cruise@su10mo4 from 3.2), we can trun on the verbose gc during runtime.

Steps:

1. Install the 3.2-nighlty.
2. start the TC server
3. Launch the dev console and connect to the server
4. In the dev console, Select Server Array | ipaddress:port | Logging Settings in the right pane
5. check the Verbose GC under Java GC and click the Request GC

Actual: GC info is printed in the command window (as expected)

[GC 31546K->10874K(517056K), 0.0485429 secs]
[Full GC 10874K->10862K(517056K), -0.6350318 secs]
