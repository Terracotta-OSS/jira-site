## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a clustered session setup using tomcat 5.5, terracotta 2.4-stable0, and wicket 1.3. If I hit tomcat directly using localhost:8083 and localhost:8084 the clustering setup works perfect. However if I put apache in front of the mix and use mod jk to round robin load balance between the two servers (using tomcat's mod jk connector) the clustering does not appear to happen at all (session attributes are not shared).

As of revision 4045  in terracotta 2.4, the jvmRoute from tomcat's configuration (if defined) will be placed in session identifier. This is what mod\_jk is expecting.
