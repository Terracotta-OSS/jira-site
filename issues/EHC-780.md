## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We should consider implementing either:

1. Element as Externalizable and then customizing serialization of the value object for specific types (e.g. byte[]).

2. Providing full on pluggable serialization schemes (e.g. protocol buffers, json etc...)


</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The idea here is to provide a further speed up to Off-Heap Store.

Ultimately we put this in the hands of the user as they can then use how to serialise which is useful to them: protocol buffer, json etc.

We are going to optimize Element and byte array for Magnum and do the pluggable version in Freo

Moving to Ulloa we were aware that this was probably not going to happen in Freo
