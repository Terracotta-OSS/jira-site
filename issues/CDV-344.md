## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I uninstalled and reinstalled.  my eclipse plugin says it has 2.4.0.r3946\_xxxxxx, but identifies itself when starting as 2.4-stable1.
there don't seem to be options to install anything but this version (aren't we going to do multiple revisions at the site, and what about upgrading?)

I believe you're using the old update site. We have the new sites here. We started to use the new sites since 2.4.0 final

	http://download.terracotta.org/eclipse/update --> final
        http://download.terracotta.org/nightly/eclipse/update --> nightly
