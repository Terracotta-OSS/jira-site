## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I know that Mac OS X isn't a supported platform but it would be nice to fix this since it affects half of dev.  Seems like this wasn't previously available but now it is so should be fixable.

I basically upgraded to Sigar 1.6.2.

Changes are here:

Some of the native libs were renamed to not have a version number since that's how they now appear in the 1.6.2 binary distrib.

Was fixed by Hung or Jason a while ago I think. I built a new kit from current trunk and everything Sigar-related works perfectly with JDK 1.6.
