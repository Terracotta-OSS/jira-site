If necessary we will do a 2.5.2, so please add fix to 2.5 branch

In fixing CDV-595, we inadvertently broke the ehcache 1.2.4 by introducing a dependency on an incompatible API.  The reason this was not found during testing was that the projects were incorrectly set up such that the ehcache 1.2.4 module was testing with ehcache 1.3.  That classpath/build issue has been resolved so that we won't have this issue again as long as some other previously hidden issues that popped up from the change.  The change is committed to 2.5 as rev 6951 and in trunk as 6949.
