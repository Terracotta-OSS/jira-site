## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

web clients should be able to pass a ";jsessionid=xxxx" in the URLs path parameter section in place of sending a session cookie. This construct does not work properly with terracotta clustered sessions

This seems to affect all supported containers (tomcat, weblogic, etc). 

We have a test (CookieRenameTest) that approaches this functionality, but it doesn't test the standard case of using ";jessionid=xxx". Rather it renames the session identitifer tag. Interestingly enough URL session IDs work fine as long as the tag isn't "jsessionid". It appears that the containers are stripping this before we have a chance to play with the request.

low effort (about to commit fix in trunk right now) and I think low impact/risk for pushing to 2.6
