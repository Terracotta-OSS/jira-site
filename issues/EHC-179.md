## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The class net.sf.ehcache.config.ConfigurationHelper uses several times the idiom

try \{
  className = obj.field; // obj.getter();
\} catch (Throwable t) \{
  //
\} 

where the only possible Exception is a NPE because obj could be null.

These should be rewritten as

if (obj != null)
  className = obj.field;
