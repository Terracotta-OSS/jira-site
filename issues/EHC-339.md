## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

With 250+ elements we were seeing hundreds of packets
per second at idle coming from the multicast heartbeat
ensuring the connections was still good.  I changed the
code so that it only checks the connection the first
time and assumes that if a peer has sent a subsequent
heartbeat the connection will still be good.

In registerPeer() I only update the date if the URL is
found otherwise it still performs the connection check.
