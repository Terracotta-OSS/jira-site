## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Ubuntu's default shell is dash which does not conform to standard sh syntax.

This is really a problem with Ubuntu - it should not symlink /bin/sh to /bin/dash in light of such incompatibilities.  Nonetheless, this problem affects our users from time to time and is rather obscure.

Most recently a forum user here ran into this: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1437.page

Current workaround:
1) Point /bin/sh to /bin/bash

- or -
2) update the script to be /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh

I favor (2).  Bash script is more robust and works well on all of our supported platforms.  SH shell has a lot of bugs.

Just to point out that this will get more significant in the future - http://release.debian.org/lenny/goals.txt - Debian are moving to dash as their standard sh, and are purging what they are calling "bashisms" from their shell scripts.

Someday we can see if we can provide a more cross script solutions.
For now it is documented under known issues.

I don't favor (2) - one major issue is compatiblity and ease of use on platforms like Solaris and HPUX (the former is a Terracotta supported platform, the latter is not yet suppored, but likely in the next year).

If there are any "bashims" in our sh scripts, then that is wrong - but I believe we are compatible with sh.   The real problem is as I understand it dash being incompatible with sh which seems to me to just be wrong.
