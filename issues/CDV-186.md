Gary said on 5/25 For running demos on the command line and using a server somewhere else, 
there's a system property 'tc.server' that can be set. That's what the sample launcher does. 
It's currently called tc.servers but I need to change that.  Check in with him to see what needs to be done if it isn't obvious
