## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have "diskPersistent" cache config, which works fine
until DiskStore tries to flush all accumulated entries
to disk.

Our application performs cache "dispose" during
shutdown process. However, dispose operation itself
seems to use so much memory that application server
crashes with OutOfMemoryError. Note that application
itself works fine without any memory problems. The
problem is shutdown process.

I noticed dispose actually goes to flushSpool() which
tries to compute in-memory index first. In our case
this index structure itself might be quite big. This
might be the cause for memory overflow (just a guess).

Is it possible to make this process more scalable, e.g.
remove elements from cache while building the index?

Regards,
Sergey.

The problem was caused by spoolToDisk putting each element in the 
DiskStore and then when finished clearing the MemoryStore. Because the put 
initially puts the Elements in a spool list which is also in memory you have a 
large memory spike until the spoolThread can catch up with its disk writes.

I have fixed the issue by putting the Element in the disk store and removing it 
from the memory store before moving on to the next one. A simple change 
really. testMemoryEfficiencyOfFlushWhenOverflowToDisk in CacheTest shows 
the effect. That test would cause an out of memory error on a standard 64MB 
JVM before the change.

Thanks for your bug report. The fix is in trunk and will be in 
ehcache-1.2beta6.

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
