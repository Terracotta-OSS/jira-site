## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I wonder if there isn't more we could / should do about providing support for the new features in Spring:
such as the CacheWriters: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/3351.page 
But there might be others. I think QA might have other ideas. I remember hacking a couple of things around the ehcacheperf for easier "configuration file only setup changes"...
