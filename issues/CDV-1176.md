## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Fault found in Terracotta 2.7.3 (also 2.7.0)

File:                     code/base/dso-l1/src/com/tc/object/bytecode/ManagerImpl.java,
Method:              public boolean isDsoMonitorEntered(Object o) :
The line 
502:    if (!dsoMonitorEntered && isManaged(o)) \{
could be changed to
502:    if (!dsoMonitorEntered && isManaged(o) && !this.txManager.isTransactionLoggingDisabled()) \{

In our case, o contained a hash table which in turn contained a SAML Assertion (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML)
with a self-reference, thus the logging of o.toString() in :
       logger
          .info("Object "
                + o
                + " is a shared object, but a shared lock...
went into a recursion that never ended.
We could see that this occurred when the transaction logging was disabled , so that condition could be added to
the if-clause.

We have entered the above patch and it solves the problem for us.
It would be great to have a correction for this problem in an official Terracotta release soon.
