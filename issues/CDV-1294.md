## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Should range from 0-10MM objects, scaled by number of L2 servers (e.g. 2 in array == 20MM).

This will help people see quickly if they are managing too much data...

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Not sure a speed dial is the right thing (since it's usually not changing rapidly like the others) but I often wish there was some way to see the current value on the default view without going into the runtime stats.

</div>
