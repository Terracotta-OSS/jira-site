## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi, 

In my admittedly high request per second load testing I've noticed very long intervals for flushing the disk spool. Sometimes in the 10+ second range.

It'd be nice if ehcache could switch to using only the memory store while the disk store was locked. That way at least there'd be a chance of a hit, and otherwise the request could be directed by the requesting code to the actual content source and possibly not block for so long.

thanks!

The MemoryStore and DiskStore can be used independently which should have resolved this issue.
