<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I don't know if there are other examples on the Cache class, but pretty much any method that returns a complex object is potentially subject to this type of issue

As it stand now we make sure all the methods on Cache are covered by nonstop behavior but it is this iteration with returned objects that can be problematic

Saro, passing this back to you as I have a large backlog and am very unlikely to get to this during Ulloah.
