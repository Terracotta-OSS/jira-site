## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Roots of literal types (primitives, enums, etc.) are not displayed in the AdminConsole correctly. This is because the ManagedObjectFacade only has the concept of fields, so a literal root comes across as an object with one field. If ManagedObjectFacade had isLiteral, I could take it that the one field is the actual value.
