## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Having two nodes competing on a RRWL with tryLock will only award the lock to the last node that held it. It seems that tryLock never causes a greedy lock to be recalled, unless a node succeeds with a normal lock request, even if nobody is contending anymore.

Also happens with ReentrantLock ... I'm now going to try to rewrite my testcase to use lower-level operations to see if this is a bug at the core lock manager, or in these lock classes.

Seems like the best solution is to simply send out a lock recall if it is greedily held by others, but not wait for it. This will make the tryLock return immediately, but allow later try lock requests to succeed since the lock might already be recalled.
