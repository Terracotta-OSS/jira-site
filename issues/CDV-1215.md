## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think it would be very handy to have build information embedded and logged in TIMs that we produce. I'm talking about the kind of information that is present in build-data.txt for core kit (revision, branch, user, date ,etc). 

This is especially helpful with snapshot builds so you can tell one from another. It can also be helpful in verifying exactly what code is being used in the event that a TIM is misrepresenting itself.

Can you investigate whether this is possible in Maven?  I assume during the assembly phase that builds the jar we would want to inject some properties into the manifest.  Some properties would be easy to obtain but not sure about svn info.  Tim did some stuff to grab that in Examinator prod builds if you want to look there.

Added changes in tim-parent trunk (rev-14922) and tc-maven-plugin trunk (rev-14923)

Will need changes in the release/snapshot publisher to supply the argument like "-Doutput-svn-info=true" to activate the profile.

Abhishek, could you merge this to tc-3.0 of tim-parent and tc-maven-plugin? This is targeted to 3.0.x also
