## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, the three sample apps can never be removed from the session configuration. This is weird, since once people get past the initial Terracotta try-out period, they'd want to use the configurator without the overhead of having the example apps being present all the time. Like for your own wars, you should be able to remove the sample apps.
