## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently the console hides roots that start with "@".  That caused our work with the jetty guys to take longer as they couldn't see what was happening (and most of us didn't know these were hidden).  

Seems like a bad idea to categorically hide stuff in the console without at least an option to un-hide.  I know there is a desire to hide complication from users but seems like this may be too much to me.
