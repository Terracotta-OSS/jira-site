## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

With ServerMaps, the already hot objectmanager becomes even more contended at the server as the attached thread dumps suggest. Some amount of batching that was/is implemented after the threaddumps were taken helps. Still it will be nice to have a concurrent Object Manager that can service multiple requests simultaneously.

Since there is a lot of history to that class it is not a straightforward change.
