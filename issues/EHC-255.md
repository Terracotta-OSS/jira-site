## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Be able to link xsd to xml is usefull using tools like
eclipse.

But we have the following error if we do so:

Caused by: net.sf.ehcache.CacheException: Error
configuring from file:xxx/WEB-INF/classes/ehcache.xml.
Initial cause was Error configuring from input stream.
Initial cause was null:2: Element <ehcache> does not
allow attribute "xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation"

And I link ehcache using the following code.
<ehcache
xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
 xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="ehcache.xsd">

instead of 
<ehcache>

Ok, I debugged through SAX parser and Xerces hell and found the problem in 
ehcache's very own BeanHandler. Added the following code to allow arbitrary 
attributes to be added to the <ehcache> element.  

//allow references to an XML schema but do not use it
                if (element.elementName.equals("ehcache")) {
                    if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                        LOG.debug("Ignoring ehcache attribute " + attrName);
                    }
                    return;
                }

I have changed my ehcache.xml files over to your syntax. Very nice. IntelliJ 
does the same trick as eclipse.

Thanks for the bug report. This will be in ehcache-1.2.3.

BTW moved this to feature requests.
