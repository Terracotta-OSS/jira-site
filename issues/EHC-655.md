## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Say an ehcache.xml is not in the classpath and you wanted to create CacheManager and clustered caches programmatically 
Like the following:

CacheManager cacheManager = CacheManager.create();
CacheConfiguration cacheConfiguration = new CacheConfiguration(regionName,maxObjects);
cacheConfiguration.setOverflowToDisk(false);
cacheConfiguration.setEternal(isEternal);
cacheConfiguration.setTimeToLiveSeconds(timeToLiveSeconds);
cacheConfiguration.setTimeToIdleSeconds(timeToIdleSeconds);
cacheConfiguration.setDiskPersistent(false);
cacheConfiguration.setDiskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds(diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds);
cacheConfiguration.terracotta(new TerracottaConfiguration().clustered(true).valueMode(ValueMode.IDENTITY));
cache = new Cache(cacheConfiguration);
cacheManager.addCache(cache);

The cache manager is not properly initialized to the terracotta aware, since when CacheManager.create() is called
there are no caches that are clustered. This is different from the cache where caches are defined through ehcache.xml
since on the call CacheManager.create() the clustered caches defined in ehcache.xml are already present.

Is this related to DEV-3826?

Might be, looks like in both cases, the CacheManager is not aware of having to be clustered.

Nabib, when you say it's not properly initialized, what in particular is your problem? DEV-3826 is known about, however your cache and cache manager functionalities itself should be totally working as soon as a TC clustered cache is added to the cache manager. The TC initialization parts are done lazily in these cases.

Sorry, is was a classpath issue in performance framework. Code works correctly.
