## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Just wanted to give you a heads up that I've run into quite a few issues
with the Terracotta for Eclipse plugin and the EE version of Eclipse.
This would be specifically related to the package explorer dialogs not
filtering the correct entity types. Last I checked we're applying
filters to the custom package explorer implementation using explicit
lists of allowed types (what to display, class, method, etc.). They
probably changed this slightly for EE so you guys would need to figure
out which new types to include in the list. Should be fairly strait forward.

Otherwise it's been a really awesome tool to have.

hmm, the way I read it sounds like he is talking about the JEE version of eclipse, nothing to do with our "enterprise" stuff.
