## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a disk store sized in bytes is topped by a caching tier sized in entries and the latter one ends up creating an inverted pyramid, the disk store inline eviction fails to free the {{DiskMarker}}.
Guilty code is in {{net.sf.ehcache.store.disk.Segment#faultInternal}} in the block {{if (incomingDiskSize < 0) {}}.

See this [discussion|https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/ehcache-users/ehcache-core/Vq7kJPghkpE] which discovered the problem and which contains a test which exhibits the problem as long as the onheap size is changed to be between 191 and 1000.
