## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The Page and PageFragment Cache functionality of EHCache is extremely broad stroked and in most cases not very useful. Typically, a web developer needs more fine grained control over what to cache in a page. And for this purpose a JPS taglibrary would be useful. OSCache had one of those (http://java.net/projects/oscache/sources/svn/show/branches/v2\11\11/src/core/java/com/opensymphony/oscache/web/tag?rev=344) and perhaps it could be ported to EHCache or used as inspiration. Grails also has such a tag available but it's specific to grails. 

The general structure of the tag would be 

```
<ehcache:cache name="myCache" key="myUrl" condition="true|false">
...cacheable content...
</ehcache:cache>
```

name: the name of the cache defined in ehcache.xml
key: a unique key under which to store the content
condition: a boolean that determines whether to cache or not. If false, the code between ehcache:cache tags will be normally processed.

It could be beneficial to be able to expire a cache key also

```
<ehcache:expire name="myCache" key="myUrl"/>

<ehcache:expire name="myCache" allEntries="true"/>
```


name: the name of the cache defined in ehcache.xml
key: a unique key under which content is stored
allEntries: whether to expire all entries in the cache

A caching tag library would be the perfect complement to EHCache and I'm sure it would speed up my pages considerably.

It's not entirely clear what the status is of this item. It's marked resolved but doesn't have a target release date or relevant comment associated with it. Also strange that an Anonymous user made these changes.

This was inadvertently resolved.
Re-opening and investigating the "Anonymous" closing issue.
Thank you for commenting to bring it to our attention.
