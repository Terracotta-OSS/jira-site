## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We’ve discovered that there exists a massive objects allocation in method BruteForceSearchManager.getCombinedExtractors during query execution. This method is called for every element in cache during search and combines both static and dynamic data extractors:

```    private Map<String, AttributeExtractor> getCombinedExtractors(Map<String, AttributeExtractor> configExtractors, DynamicAttributesExtractor
            dynIndexer, Element element) {
        Map<String, AttributeExtractor> combinedExtractors = new HashMap<String, AttributeExtractor>();
        combinedExtractors.putAll(configExtractors);

        if (dynIndexer != null) {
...
                AttributeExtractor old = combinedExtractors.put(entry.getKey(), new AttributeExtractor() {
...
        }
        return combinedExtractors;
    }
```

However, if dynamic extractors are not specified for particular cache, then allocation of new HashMap with copy of all the configured extractors is not required, thus it can be removed in such case:

```    private Map<String, AttributeExtractor> getCombinedExtractors(Map<String, AttributeExtractor> configExtractors, DynamicAttributesExtractor
            dynIndexer, Element element) {
        if (dynIndexer != null) {
            Map<String, AttributeExtractor> combinedExtractors = new HashMap<String, AttributeExtractor>();
            combinedExtractors.putAll(configExtractors);
...
                AttributeExtractor old = combinedExtractors.put(entry.getKey(), new AttributeExtractor() {
...
            return combinedExtractors;
        } else {
            return configExtractors;
        }
    }```
                

We've made a small JMH test ([attached|^ehtest-benchmark.zip]) to test proposed [fix|^BruteForceSearchManager.java] - searching objects among 500K elements. Tests were executed with and without fix (using command '-f 1 -i 10 -bm avgt -prof gc'). Here are the results (running on Core i3-4130):
{noformat}Before fix:
Benchmark                                              Mode  Cnt            Score          Error   Units
CacheTest.testSearch                                   avgt   10            0,292 ?        0,012    s/op
CacheTest.testSearch:·gc.alloc.rate.norm               avgt   10  152 394 528,600 ?     8385,450    B/op

After fix:
Benchmark                                              Mode  Cnt            Score          Error   Units
CacheTest.testSearch                                   avgt   10            0,166 ?        0,001    s/op
CacheTest.testSearch:·gc.alloc.rate.norm               avgt   10   24 393 720,419 ?     4809,227    B/op{noformat}

So, introducing of this fix resulted in 5x decrease of objects allocation rate (152M -> 24M) and ~2x increase in search performance (292 ms -> 166 ms).

Thanks Alexey for the report and the contribution.

This has been applied on trunk and merged back on 2.9.x and 2.8.x lines.

I will close once testing confirms this does not cause any problem.
