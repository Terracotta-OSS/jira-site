## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Enable prioritizing the TC active server election on TC server swapping.
For example, something like:
<servers>
    <server host="%i" name="Server1">
          <priority>1</priority>
          ...
   </server>
    <server host="%i" name="Server2">
          <priority>2</priority> 
          ...   
    </server>

Motivation: 
We configured a group of three TC servers. Two of the servers are located on strong machines, and the third one is on a weaker machine. 
I would like to prioritize them, in order to make the TC mechanism give the "strong" standby a higher priority than the "weak" one on swapping.
