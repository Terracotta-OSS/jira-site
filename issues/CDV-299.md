## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The wicket module should contain the following snipets in the instrumented-classes section:

                <include>
                    <class-expression>org.apache.wicket.util.template..*</class-expression>
                    <honor-transient>true</honor-transient>
                </include>
                <include>
                    <class-expression>org.apache.wicket.util.resource..*</class-expression>
                    <honor-transient>true</honor-transient>
                </include>

It is unknown if honor transient is required on either of these entries however honor-transient=true has been tested and works.

I just committed a change that let some classes that were overlooked in the first Serializable -> IClusterable pass. They now implement IClusterable.

That should cover it, right?

That list looks good although I can not remember exactly what classes were giving me issues. The entry for org.apache.wicket.util.template may be because we were accidentally getting a TextTemplate included in session but I will have to verify that. Next time I get back to wicket 1.3 I will update and give these changes a try (probably wont be for a week or so).

Resolved by wicket fix.

Now I am confused. So, do we need separate 1.4 module for wicket or should we add something into 1.3 module to handle Wicket 1.3?

### **Ryan Crumley** <span class="date">2007-06-26</span>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

This fix was applied in the wicket 1.3 svn (wicket 1.3 is not final yet) so no fix is neccesary to terracotta.

Oh. Cool! Thanks Ryan. I got confused by Eelco's list that says 1.4. Missed last part of your comment about 1.3

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

We (Wicket) keep the projects that are compatible with 1.4 in a separate branch (from the other projects that are 1.5 and up). :)

I think this is OK to close. If all the info is contained in the wicket tree, we shouldn't have to verify.
