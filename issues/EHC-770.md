## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The terracotta clustered and off heap cache Store use an "optimized" serialization format. In particular the class descriptors are replaced with an integer mapping maintained in another data structure. This trick removes most of the repeated information present in the serialized form of each cache entry. 

This JIRA is to potentially implement the same optimization for the disk store.
