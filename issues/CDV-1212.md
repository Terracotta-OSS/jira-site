## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">


L1 <-> ssh tunnel <-> L2's

using attached config.

setup:
1. L2S2 & L2S3 are on machineA
2. L1 is on machineB
3. ssh tunnel created by executing on machineA:
    ssh -v -o "KeepAlive=yes" -Llocalhost:7101:localhost:7101 -Llocalhost:7102:localhost:7102 -Llocalhost:7103:localhost:7103 -Rlocalhost:7201:localhost:7201 -Rlocalhost:7202:localhost:7202 -Rlocalhost:7203:localhost:7203 -Rlocalhost:7301:localhost:7301 -Rlocalhost:7302:localhost:7302 -Rlocalhost:7303:localhost:7303 ssh@machineB


steps to replicate issue:

1.	L2S2 - active
2.	L2S3 - passive
3.	start L1, can connect to active; kill L1
4.	force L2 failover
5.	L2S3 - active
6.	L2S2 - passive
7.	start L1, can Not connect to active (do not kill L1). message repeated:  "WARN - Timeout connecting to server: localhost:7202. Timeout of 10000 milliseconds occurred"
8.	force L2 failover
9.	L2S2 - active
10.	L2S3 - passive
11.	now L1 (from 7.) can connect 
12.	force L2 failover
13.	L2S3 - active
14.	L2S2 - passive
15.	L1 still connected (jmx thisNodeDisconnect & thisNodeConnect received)


issue:
behavior should be the same as when ssh tunnels aren't used; searching for all the L2's not only the first one secified in the config file.

for normal behavior, modify config file, replacing "localhost" with appropriate values

environment:
1. using 2.7.3
2. machineA - solaris 10 on sparc
3. machineB - windows xp sp3

Hi there,

I think that there is a problem with the ssh tunnel configuration. -Llocalhost:7101:localhost:7101 for example is forwarding the port 7101 on machineA to port 7101 on machineA.

I ran a couple of tests with ssh tunneling and I was not able to reproduce the problem: everything including failover is working as expected. Here is my configuration:
- server sales02: first L2 (dso port: 9510)
- server sales03: second L2 (dso port: 9511)
- server sales04: L1

On sales04, I created the ssh tunnel using the following command: ssh -f -N -L9510:sales02:9510 sales02 && ssh -f -N -L9511:sales03:9511 sales03

The trick is that the tc-config.xml for the L2 and L1 are differents. I have attached the 2 tc-config.xml I am using:
- tc-config-server.xml is for the L2s
- tc-config.xml for the L1

Differences between tc-config.xml and tc-config-server.xml:
tc-config-server.xml: 
<server name="server1" host="sales02">
[...]
<server name="server2" host="sales03">

tc-config.xml:
<server name="server1" host="localhost">
[...]
<server name="server2" host="localhost">

Hope this helps,

Cheers,

Sylvain
