## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently we have one session "Module" but different containers have some subtle differences. I.e. each one has stuff we want to exclude for performance reasons that can never be clustered anyway. We need to move to a model where we have a "common-container" module and then specific modules for each of the various containers we support.

Worth noting that multiple people have run into this issue so I would clasify it as a high priority usability issue.

on the topic of default excludes, a better approach might be to somehow cut off entire loaders from applying DSO instrumentation.

I'm fine with that. I think we might have other differences between containers that could be dealt with in modules as well
