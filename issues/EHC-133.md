## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It is not right place to use SoftReferences, because
even removals can be reclaimed by VM. this is very badddd.

I suggest soft referencing only the payload, thus
invalidating a cache entry, whose payload has been
reclaimed. This is much safer.
