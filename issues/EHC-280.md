## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Consider this situation: Ehcache is used as a plugin 
with Hibernate. Two Hibernate mapping files are 
available for different purposes: one for an application 
with only properties actually used by the application 
(MFA), and one for an importer utility with a fuller set of 
properties which aren't all used by the application 
(MFB). The Hibernate configuration file uses MFB, and 
the import utility has the application files in its 
classpath.  When invoking the importer, rather than 
using MFB as Hibernate does (following its own 
configuration file), Ehcache seems to use MFA which is 
in the same directory as a class included in the 
classpath.

Perhaps a 'mapping file' property should be introduced 
into the configuration file to accommodate this 
situation.  Alternatively, when Ehcache is used as a 
plugin with Hibernate it should use the mapping file 
indicated in the Hibernate configuration file.

Keep up the good work.

Cheers,
Callum.
