## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Default installation directory for Terracotta is "Program Files\terracotta-<version>".

If I already have "Program Files\myDirectory" and change the installation path in the installer to "Program Files\myDirectory\terracotta-<version>" then the installer claims that it'll have to create the directory myDirectory. Typical Windows installer behavior is to recognize that the directory is already there.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

 the message is incorrect. It should state the directory terracotta-,version> needs to be created.
