## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The CacheFilter implementation should be aware of cache control headers. This would help to use the filter along with application logic that marks dynamic not cacheable content this way. Which seems in not very unusual too me.

Can you create an RMP called Web Caching Improvements. And add this one to it. I will then flick others I find as I trawl through into that category. Then we can consider prioritisation of it as a whole.
