## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a quarantined client re-connect attempt is rejected due to a server bounce sans permanent-store persistence-mode, provide better messaging as to the cause and inform of remedies: (1) manually terminate clients and keep going or, (2) change persistence-mode to permanent-store and restart cluster.

The message of concern:
ConnectionID(0.8759f44cca6948718f7a66ba18bae64b): Connection refused  

An example of the confusion:
http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1709.page

Also, the online document referred to by the forum thread doesn't make it absolutely clear that permanent-store mode is required for HA:
http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Configuring+Terracotta+For+High+Availability

Background for Igal:
The server stores the client connections in its database for fail over reasons.  When the server instances are not configured for a persistent database, at server restart those connections are lost since the database is cleared.  Now a previously connected client tries to reconnect to the newly started server instance.  The server doesn't find a match for the connection and the above message is printed to the server log.  If persistence-store mode is on, the database isn't cleared and the old client is allowed to reconnect.

Latest build (rev11611) puts out this message:

2009-02-11 12:28:00,852 INFO - Unable to find communications stack. ConnectionID(0.686d84df57e44c6eadb221cce42a0e84) not found. Connection is being requested from 10.0.0.92:50265. This is usually caused by a client that is not connected to the cluster. While that client is being rejected, everything else should proceed as normal. Some possible reasons for this situation might be: the client is from a previous run and can't safely join this newer run; or the client couldn't reconnect (configurable through several TC properties: 'l2.l1reconnect.enabled', 'l2.l1reconnect.timeout.millis', ...)

A more concise message is needed.

Below is the new suggested message.

2009-02-11 12:28:00,852 INFO - Client Cannot Reconnect
ConnectionID(0.686d84df57e44c6eadb221cce42a0e84) not found. Connection attempts from the Terracotta client at 10.0.0.92:50265 are being rejected by the Terracotta server array.  Restart  the client to allow it to rejoin the cluster. Many client reconnection failures can be avoided by configuring the Terracotta server array for "permanent-store" and tuning reconnection parameters.

Igal, can you have the link be converted to a redirect with Dave?  Otherwise it is fine, so when the redirect has been added just assign back to Transparency Team.
