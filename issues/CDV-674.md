## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Get rid of Websphere Application Server scripts for the Sessions Configurator in the kit.

It is not even referenced in the Sessions Configurator server list, and from Gary has told me, it is not even being tested.
We should not include it in the kit, and delete it from our source tree.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Websphere is definitely tested in the Monkeys
# Websphere 6.1.0.7
# WebSphere CE 1.2


It is true that there was not yet a requirement to have it work in the Configurator, there was an effort to review what it would take to get CE working in configurator. LKC-2723. 
The conclusion was that the amount of effort it would take was not worth it.

Yes but this is targeted for 2.6.1, so  no need to check it in until after 2.6.0 is released.

That is work on other Pacheco targeted or Forge items before moving onto 2.6.1 targeted items
