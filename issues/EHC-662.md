## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

All cache configuration should be able to be done programmatically, so that those using IoC approaches can use all features.

CacheWriter does not support this - it can only be done through config.

The CacheConfiguration class allows cache writers to be registered in Java with a CacheWriterConfiguration instance. The actual instance of the cache writer can be added through the registerCacheWriter method on the cache instance. What else did you have in mind?
