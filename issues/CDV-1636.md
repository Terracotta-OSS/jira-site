## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/7680.page#37330

In the below link
http://ehcache.org/apidocs/net/sf/ehcache/event/CacheEventListener.html 

The NotifyElementExpired docs say
"As the Element has been expired, only what was the key of the element is known."

According to Alex Snaps in the forum post, this is incorrect.

Well, let's wait to see if there is a reproducible test-case or not... I don't feel we got all the information yet to dismiss this entirely.
Also, even though I think none of the store implementations actually would expose such a behaviour, the question whether we want to guarantee otherwise is another... We might also want to figure out how this made it there to begin with...
There \_might\_ be a good reason for it... I just don't know about any.
