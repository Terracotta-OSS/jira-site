## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The pom of net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core:1.6.2 refers to the parent pom net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-parent:2.0-SNAPSHOT which forces all users to use the snapshot repository. A user of a released version should never need to access the snapshot repository. Neither should a release refer to a parent pom with a higher version than the component itself.
The pom net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core:1.6.2 should either not refer to any parent pom or refer a parent pom with a version like 1.6.x or 1.6.2 but most important one that is located in the release repository.

This was fixed a few days ago under another bug - EHC409.

I don't have access to EHC409. In which repository can I find the fixed pom? The following pom sitll referes to a snapshot version of the parent pom:
http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-releases/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache-core/1.6.2/ehcache-core-1.6.2.pom

Here is the link to the fixed issue: (found it now)
https://jira.terracotta.org/jira//browse/EHC-409
The following URL referes now to a proper parent pom. (Is this being overwritten again and again? Hope it stays that way now.)
http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-releases/net/sf/ehcache/ehcache/1.6.2/ehcache-1.6.2.pom

Well, after posting the comment I saw that this bug was no duplicate because it's not the same pom! However there is no possibility to reopen the bug.
