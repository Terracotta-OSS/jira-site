## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In Ehcache 1.6 the web package was broken out into the ehcache-web module. However the ShutdownListener is useful even if you are not using web caching - you use it to shutdown a CacheManager in a web app, when the servlet container shuts down. For that reason it should be in core. Putting it back.

1. Add following to <web-app> in ehcache-dx-sample webapp. Note: The project doesnt have dependency on ehcache-web.
<listener>
      <listener-class>net.sf.ehcache.constructs.web.ShutdownListener</listener-class>
 </listener>
2. Change log4j logging level to DEBUG
3. Log prints out
DEBUG [net.sf.ehcache.constructs.web.ShutdownListener] - Shutting down 4 CacheManagers.
