## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I was running tcbuild on 2.5 branch on Windows with cygwin in a root directory with spaces.  I received the following error:

...[snip]...
Compiling modules-common/src... with hotspot-1.4.2\112

[   11.05 seconds] Build failed:
Received exception from the build system: BUILD FAILED
org.leafcutter.core.TaskRunnerException: Can't initialise 'manifest': null
[RuntimeError] 

When I renamed the root dir with no spaces, everything worked.  We should either make this work or detect and print useful error message.
