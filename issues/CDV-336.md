## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When trying to debug a test (MapOfMapsTest in my example) the TCDev plugin is unable to load the "launch.LaunchShortcut" class, and the details show "org.eclipse.jdt.internal.junit.launcher.JUnitLaunchShortcut"

</div>

I took a quick look at this and it's more than a 2-minute fix, so I may or may not be the best person to look at this.

If made the tcdev plugin work for Eclipse 3.3 and it can be found locally via the update site at http://fileserver/ftp/pub/eclipse/update/.

The same issues relating which version of Eclipse we're going to support that affect the DSO plugin also affect the tcdev plugin so I'm not going to push these changes to the public tcdev update site at http://download.terracotta.org/tcdev-plugin until there's resolution.

Terracotta nightly builds will work with 3.3 and terracotta 2.4 will work with Eclipse 3.2
