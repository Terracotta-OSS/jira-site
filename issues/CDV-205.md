## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The lock upgrade test, LockUpgrade1Reads1UpgradesTest, result in deadlock. Deadlock could occur if there is more than one threads within a single JVM, one doing a lockupgrade and another one acquiring a readlock as follows:

Thread 1 doing a thread upgrade as follows:

 T1: DSO MonitorEnter with Read
 T2: JVM MonitorEnter
 T3: DSO MonitorEnter with Write
 T4: JVM MonitorEnter

 Thread 2 doing a read only:

 T1.5 (between T1 and T2): Dso MonitorEnter with Read
 T2.5 (between T2 and T3): JVM MonitorEnter

The test is currently disabled.

This is no longer an issue since lock upgrade is no longer supported.
