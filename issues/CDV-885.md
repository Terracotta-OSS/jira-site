## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We currently do not recognize FreeBSD as a supported client platform, but we do run on OS X which is FreeBSD 5 based.
To add or recognize FreeBSD we'll need to add FreeBSD's signature on BootJarSignature check and setup monkeys to run our battery of ests against this OS

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Patch for BootJarSignatureTest adding tests for FreeBSD.

Note: fails, but outside the test itself, needs native-tool patching first to support FreeBSD for tests to succeed I believe.
