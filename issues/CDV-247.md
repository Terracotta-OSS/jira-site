## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I try to go to http://www.terracotta.org/download/reflector.jsp?b=opentc-2.3&i=terracotta-windows-2.3-stable1.exe (and likewise with the 2.2 production build), Firefox will download between 4 megabytes and 25 megabytes of data but then the download stops and no more data is downloaded. I have just successfully downloaded the same file using Internet Explorer 7.0, so that's a workaround. This appears to be a problem with s3.amazonaws.com

I tried it with this: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

it seemed to work fine.

Note that I had my problem on Windows XP: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.8.1.3) Gecko/20070309 Firefox/2.0.0.3

granted Orion and I are probably on the same network, but I was able to use Firefox 2.0.0.3 on winXP to download that URL w/o issue.

I've just downloaded it with XP/Firefox 2.0 from my home network without hiccup. Could be a temporary issue.

I tried this again just now and again it failed. This time it downloaded 37.9 megabytes. I'm using wifi and might occasionally have a loss of connectivity (not that I noticed one). Maybe Iyer can try this when he's on site visiting on Friday.

I \*was\* able to download the 2.3.0 final release today on the same network with the same machine & software (maybe I didn't get a temporary loss of wifi connectivity this time?)

I hit this problem again today in trying to download the nightly build. We should have Iyer try to reproduce it tomorrow.
