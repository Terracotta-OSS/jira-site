## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There are some weird quirks and interactions in the embedded config support with how ehcache and the tc config parsers interpret stuff.  Chris has some tests that expose these issues, currently timebombed.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Issues are resolved in a similar way to the Hibernate standalone kit - can now use either tc-config or the full namespace form in a typical tc-config file.
