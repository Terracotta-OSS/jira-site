## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have a factory service where I read txt files in to 
a List of maps. 
According to my business requirement I'll find a row 
that has matching key(s). 
These finds works ok for small size of txt files. 
But for very large files, I am worried about the 
performence. So thought of trying for EHCACHE. 
I created the cache, added cache name. added list to 
element. 
how can I find my row directly from the element. 
instead of getting the list back from the element and 
find my row. 
 
here is my data looks like : 
 
List dataLst =[["eFactor":0.0000, 
"colaDurCde":null, 
"equivCPI":0.0000, "colaPct":null, 
"halfCPI":0.0000, "colaTypeCde":1, 
"version":1, "mFactor":1.0000], 
["eFactor":0.6110, "colaDurCde":3, 
"equivCPI":4.8520, 
"colaPct":8.0000, 
"halfCPI":2.4430, "colaTypeCde":4, 
"version":1, "mFactor":1.0370]] 
In the above list, each element corresponds to a row. 
I do a find(using groovy) like this 
 
dataLst.find\{row -> row.colaTypeCde == 4 
&&  
row.colaPct == 7.0000 && 
row.colaDurCde == 1\}  
 
Please reply ASAP. 
 
Is there is a way to find a row faster using EHCache 
element? The size of my txt file is around 7000 KB. 
 
Thanks in advance.

Hi

It sounds like you need to search on multiple keys. Check out jofti.com which 
provides that service. Jofti can be backed by ehcache.
