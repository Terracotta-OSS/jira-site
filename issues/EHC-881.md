## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

As Hibernate has moved som stuff around, the following imports seem to be problematic:
When activating hibernate as cache provider for Hibernate 4.0.0.Beta5 from JBoss AS 7.0.1.Final, the following error prevents deploy and launch of any entity using the cache:

Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.hibernate.cache.TimestampsRegion

lukasz.antoniak seems to have some insight, see https://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1011023 where he claims that the following clases are problematic.


import org.hibernate.cache.CacheDataDescription;
import org.hibernate.cache.CacheException;
import org.hibernate.cache.CollectionRegion;
import org.hibernate.cache.EntityRegion;
import org.hibernate.cache.QueryResultsRegion;
import org.hibernate.cache.RegionFactory;
import org.hibernate.cache.Timestamper;
import org.hibernate.cache.TimestampsRegion;
import org.hibernate.cache.access.AccessType;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Settings;

Most of them seem just to have moved inte org.hibernate.cache.spi.Xxx, but Timestamper has moved to .internal and TimestampRegion has vanished.

Is there any plan for when Hibernate 4.0 will be supported?

No. This is in Hibernate though.
So basically using the org.hibernate.\* ehcache provider classes should solve his problem. I replied on the forum. Will do the same here and close as not a bug.

The ehcache-core packaged classes are not meant to be used with Hibernate 4
Hibernate Core 4 has a hibernate-ehcache module, that has the RegionFactory classes for 4.0 support.
org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.EhCacheRegionFactory & org.hibernate.cache.ehcache.SingletonEhCacheRegionFactory should work fine. If you have any issue feel free to ask on our forums: http://forums.terracotta.org
