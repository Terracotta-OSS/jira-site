## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It seems like only the job map entries that are put into the JobDataMap before adding the job to the JobScheduler are preserved across the client/server boundary.

I am not sure of customers Quartz version used. I have requested that info.

That's always true, for any job store, and not just for RMI client/server use cases.  (Even for 100% local).

If you change a job/trigger, you must re-store it if you want the scheduler to know about it.

Can we add this to FAQ? It comes up quite often.
