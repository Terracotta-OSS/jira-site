I might be wrong here but it seems like you need to use .SNAPSHOT in meta file to please OSGi.

Yes, you are right - this is coming from tim-annotations version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.  But supposedly the build process was supposed to magically manage the conversion from 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT to 1.0.0.SNAPSHOT just by depending on tim-parent, this seems to have broken.

The actual problem here is that the bootjar told me there was a problem loading a TIM, and the problem is due to the Bundle-Version header, but it does not tell me WHICH bundle caused the problem.  This is rather problematic to actually resolve and requires some major effort on the developer part to track down the actual bundle causing the problem.

The fix is that the bootjar should have told me which bundle caused the problem.
