## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since we won't be distinguishing between Linux and Solaris kits, and the JRE's for the Unix kits will also not be included, so we cannot assume what type of bootjar to include when we build the kits.

We need for our scripts to autogenerate the bootjars the first time it is needed.
