## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

For plain express toolkit users there is no exposed way to shut down the client! 

org.terracotta.api.TerracottaClient likely needs a shutdown method that would in turn call shutdown() the Client instance it has

This is an easy fix but one that would change the public API so it should be done only when we must/want to push the toolkit API version number
