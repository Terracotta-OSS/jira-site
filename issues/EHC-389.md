## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Clustered caches are identified in the internal cluster state via a combination of cache manager name and cache name.  Changing the cache manager name at runtime may cause a clustered store to be "lost".  Not sure whether this is a real use case and/or an important one.

Do you and Chris still think this is a serious issue or not?

It is still an issue. How serious though... no idea. Once you understood the thing conceptually, I guess you wouldn't be surprised.
