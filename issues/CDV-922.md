## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Probably not a big deal, but it seems every await() call in CyclicBarrier creates a new object.  

See the attached screenshot for a test that runs a cyclicbarrier with 5 processes/threads.  The overall rate of barrier acquisition is between 20-30, which corresponds very well with the object creation rate, e.g. 5\120 is 100, which is the object flush and fault rate, indicating to me that new objects are used to indicate an arrival of a thread (I haven't seen the code - maybe they are being put into a map?)

I have implemented a small version of code that uses just a counter (it should be a long, not an int):

public class MyCyclicBarrier
{
    private final int parties;
    private int joined = 0;

    public MyCyclicBarrier(final int parties)
    {
        this.parties = parties;
    }

    public synchronized int getNumberWaiting() { return joined % parties; }

    public synchronized void await() throws InterruptedException
    {
       int myCycle = joined / parties;
       joined++;
       if (joined % parties == 0) { notifyAll(); return; }
       while (myCycle >= (joined / parties)) { wait(); }
    }
}

seems cyclic barrier creates an inner class which is the source of the garbage
