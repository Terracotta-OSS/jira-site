## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need a way to determine which L2 was active last...that should take weight at the election time.  Maybe all L2's that went down as an active report "I think I was active and my last transaction ID is XXX".  Then the one with the highest transaction ID wins?  Make it a property for 3.2 that is disabled by default so that there are no risks in the community but eventually allow "l2.nha.autoRestorePreviousMaster=true" to be a default  (of course, ignore my feature designing in JIRA...it is just to get the concept across in succinct fashion).

Not sure if I totally understand why this is needed yet but... One way to achieve this would be to have each node store the timestamp of the last time he became active somewhere.
