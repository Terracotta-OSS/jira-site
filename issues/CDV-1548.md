## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Through the iterator.remove on Cache.getKeys() one can remove elements from the cache. This is against the javadoc of Cache.getKeys() that says the list is not live. 

It also can break search in 3.5.0 since the remove happens without sending any meta data
