## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In tim-map-evictor, there is a time stamp entry class that updated it's timestamp using a concurrent lock.  we should use the same lock that is used in the csm map, so that way we don't create a new ClientLock object to update the timstampEntry, attach is a patch that demonstrates this.

the lockID used for the timestamp update should now be identical to the one used in the underlying CSM
