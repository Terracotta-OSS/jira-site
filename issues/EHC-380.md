## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From Tim:

FYI: I ran a quick test that used both standalone hibernate and standalone
ehache in the same app. It seemed to work fine except for getting an OOME
the first time I ran it. The memory requirements are pretty high depending
on what you're doing. I don't know how much you know about JarManager but
it keeps the "virtual" jars (jars inside jars) loaded into memory until
they are idle for 30 seconds. I just made up that number and I think it is
fine, but dropping it to something like 100ms would probably let me test
run okay in 64MB.
