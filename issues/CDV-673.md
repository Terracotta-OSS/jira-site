## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

sessions configurator need to put quotes in paths when it contains spaces.

1. Open up the Terracotta Sessions Configurator
2. Select File|Servers...
3. Select a server, the JAVA\1HOME and (eg) CATALINA\1HOME will be set, by default no quotes surround these values even if the values contains spaces. We need to quote these values so that the Windows batch scripts will work correctly.
