## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, there is no way to uniquely identify individual nodes in a repeatable fashion.

This for example prevents several nodes on the same machine to easily have different log directories without resorting to using different users or JVM properties. The causes the default tc.config.xml to not support log files by default for more than one L1 node on the same machine. The same is true for CVT agents buffer databases.

Suggestion by Hung:
I was wondering if we could use ClientID (assinged to each client by DSO server) as a unique folder name for the clients' logs. If users specify the paths in tc-config.xml then we'll use those. If not, dump all logs and statistics files to  workingdir/terracotta/$ClientID

Observation about that from me:
Using the client ID is more difficult than it sounds since it only gets assigned when the actual connection between L1 and L2 is established. This currently happens after all the startup logic of L1. It might need quite a large amount of shuffling around and refactoring.

we are not sure this is the right approach. We will evaluate and enter new jiras when we figure out the best approach
