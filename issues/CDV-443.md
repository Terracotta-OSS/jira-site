## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently we store the L1's system time in the TimeMap for doing invalidation in sessions and cache eviction in implementations such as Ehcache.  If  two different L1 have huge differences in system time then evicition or invalidation may not be accurate.

One way to solve this is to have logical clocks that gets synced with L2.

Would the logical clock also be able to act as a heartbeat?

We could piggy back logical clock on heart beats but if we maintain the logical clock as a delta  to system time in the L1, we only need to sync once during handshake.

Well...  we need to sync once in a while if we want to take care of clock drift or change in system time.
