## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the main source tree there is a maven POM at code/base/pom.xml that produces an artifact at org\terracotta\parent. The name of this project is way too generic in my opinion (I don't really know what this module is about so I don't know what to call it).

Beside the name, the dependencies declared in parent's pom.xml seem old and not regularly maintained. For instance it still lists apache-tribes and I've recently need to update the version of tc-cargo-uberjar and ant. Is there any change the set of dependencies and the version can be tied back to our ivy files somehow?

This "parent" module happens to be the parent POM for the "terracotta" and "terracotta-api" modules so anyone using those is exposed the dependencies.

Address this issue by generating Maven dependencies from Ivy dependencies (or vice versa).  See linked issue.
