Is this something we can fix easily? i.e. don't spend more than an hour on it

You're quite correct, the InnerClasses attributes were not being updated correctly during TC class instrumentation.  I've just checked in a fix for this in the trunk of tim-api (http://svn.terracotta.org/fisheye/changelog/Terracotta/tim-api/trunk?cs=16801).  I'm also going to code a separate fix that will go out with the next release of the TC core (3.5.0) - tim-api is not being released with this, so this has to be done independently.  I'll close this JIRA when that is complete.

I have now applied a temporary fix for this in trunk (this will go out with TC core 3.5.0).  The test for this asserts that it is still running against the broken tim-api version, so that we remember to remove the temporary fix when a new version of tim-api is released.
