## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

One of my users downloaded the new TC 3.0 kit.  The installer said that everything was successful and placed  welcome.bat and dev-console icons on his desktop.

When he clicked on either of those icons, nothing happened.  We checked the Event Logs in XP and there were no errors or warnings of any kind.

Only after we opened a command prompt and ran the welcome.bat program by hand did we discover that the problem was that there was not JAVA\1HOME variable set.

We opened the Control panel and updated JAVA to the latest version from Sun, but still, the Terracotta icons did nothing.  JAVA\1HOME did not seem to be set by the Sun installer either.

WE  no longer include a JRE with the windows kit.  
JAVA\1HOME needs to be set when using windows or any other OS to run Terracotta.

We are making this clearer in the 3.0.0 release notes.

Maybe we should just fail to install on Windows if JAVA\1HOME isn't set.

Maybe we should warn them that the product they just installed won't run until they set JAVA\1HOME

Seems like it would be a nice addition to the installer to either tell people that or help them set it if it isn't set to something valid?

Add text to the installer at the final screen (Step 7 of 7) in bold:


"PLEASE NOTE:  FOR TERRACOTTA TO FUNCTION PROPERLY, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR JAVA\1HOME SETTING IS SET"
