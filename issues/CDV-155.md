## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Web apps use request.getSession(..) to get a handle to the session object. When DSO sessions are used, the actual instance returned to the application is a wrapper/facade to the "real" session. That facade object cannot be made portable..... 

So if an app tries to reference the session object from an attribute in the session, things won't work. 

An example of something that doesn't work (but should):

  session.setAttribute("my session reference", session);

Did this really happen or is it hypothetical?

I'm going to move this into Moraga for the time being. No promises, but I want to try to look at it sooner

I've seen two instances of this so far, both in web frameworks (echo2 and jetspeed). I found the latter example while debugging things with a customer
