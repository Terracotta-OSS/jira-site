## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently, once a client loads a tc-hibernate-cache.xml file for the first time, it is never reread, even if the client is restarted.  The only way to reload the cache config file is to restart both the client and the server.

An option in the dev-console that would force a reload of the tc-hibernate-cache.xml config file would be extremely useful, as it would preclude the need to restarting the entire cluster just to load a new cache configuration.

Additionally, a client command line switch to force a reload of the cache config file would be valuable as well.

Please see http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/2554.page#15174 for additional feedback on this issue.

We've talked about his multiple times but it didn't quite make it into the release.
