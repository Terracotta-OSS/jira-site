## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Right now if you assign to an already assigned non-literal tc root, the assignment will silently fail.  Sometimes this is actually a programming bug when not being aware of tc.  Maybe we emit a warning to the tc log in this case?  Might be a useful clue.  Or have a runtime logging option for it?

I think an INFO would be appropriate here - not a WARN.  There are certainly cases where this is intentional - in fact it can be quite common.  I think in high object creation count (where the assignment is likely) it could be detrimental to have this on - so I might even argue it's a DEBUG level.

Maybe this could happen once per class not per instance.
