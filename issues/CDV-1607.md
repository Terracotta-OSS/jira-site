## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The details of the issue are in this Forum Thread - http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/6193.page#32217

Below is the essence from the Forum Thread ...

We are not being able to do what ultimately is a "Put from a notifyPut inside a listener to a different distributed cache" 

Specifically, we class A and class B running on separate JVMs and a CacheA and CacheB distributed caches. 

Class A is updating CacheA in its own cache manager instance. 
We registered a ListenerA to the CacheA 
Inside of listenerA notifyElementPut method, we put an element into CacheB. 
We registered a ListenerB to the CacheB 
ListenerB notifyElementPut performs an action. 

Whats happening is that the notifyElementPut is never getting called in ListenerB (Which runs on the second JVM) 

The workaround is to do this as part of a different Thread.

We need to decide whether to ignore this issue or if we should throw an error when people do this.

If we could somehow detect this and throw an "unsupported" error that would be great
