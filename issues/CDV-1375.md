## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

HibernateProxyApplicator attempts to emulate a PhysicalApplicator in the way it produces DNA on dehydrate(). On the server there will be a single physical state object because of this. 

One of the fields created in the DNA will be for the "id". The type of this field is control of the user and is not necessarly the same type for entities that will be clustered. This means that the server will there is there is class change occurring (simliar to two L1s running different version of the same class). Depending on the types involved this can be deemed an incompatible type change for the "id" field.
