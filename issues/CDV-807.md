## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'm running Ubuntu Hardy Heron with the following kernel:

Linux asdf 2.6.24-19-generic #1 SMP Wed Jun 18 14:15:37 UTC 2008 x86\_64 GNU/Linux

java version "1.6.0\_06"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_06-b02)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 10.0-b22, mixed mode)

After downloading and untarring terracotta-generic-2.6.2.tar.gz, I ran sessions-configurator.sh, enabled clustering, and started the sample apps. When I clicked on the links for the DepartmentTaskList or Townshend apps, I got a strange Struts-related exception. Also, the Cart application did not cluster when clicking between the 9081 and 9082 ports. 
 
I provided the log output in this forum post:
http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/1220.page

When I disable clustering, the DepartmentTaskList and Townshend apps show up properly with no Exception. The other thing is, on my 32-bit laptop which is also running Hardy Heron, the configurator works fine, and clustering works for all of the sample apps.

Leo
Can you attach the terracotta logs and your tc-config.xml  to this ticket?  
Thanks
Fiona

The forum post that I linked to above has both the tomcat logs and terracotta logs. I didn't touch the tc-config.xml file that came with the terracotta-generic-2.6.2.tar.gz  tarball. Once I get into work tomorrow I'll upload it for your edification.

Ok, this is strange. I fired up the sessions-configurator.sh just now, and the clustering is working. I'm no longer able to recreate any of the errors above. Someone feel free to close this bug as 'cannot reproduce'.
