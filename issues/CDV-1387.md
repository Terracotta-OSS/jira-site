## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There is a typo in ClientTransactionManagerImpl (shown below).

833 	  public void unpinLock(String lockName) {
834 	    lockManager.unlock(lockManager.lockIDFor(lockName));
835 	  }

This obviously has some fairly serious implications for people who use the unpin method.

As far as I am aware nobody is using this at the moment... (CDM certainly doesn't - it only uses pin and evict)
