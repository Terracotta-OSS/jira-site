## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This should be an enum....

    /\1\1
     \1 Fast but not accurate setting.
     \1/
    public static final int STATISTICS\1ACCURACY\1NONE = 0;

    /\1\1
     \1 Best efforts accuracy setting.
     \1/
    public static final int STATISTICS\1ACCURACY\1BEST\1EFFORT = 1;

    /\1\1
     \1 Guaranteed accuracy setting.
     \1/
    public static final int STATISTICS\1ACCURACY\1GUARANTEED = 2;

------------------------------------------------------------------

    public String getStatisticsAccuracyDescription() {
        if (statisticsAccuracy == 0) {
            return "None";
        } else if (statisticsAccuracy == 1) {
            return "Best Effort";
        } else {
            return "Guaranteed";
        }
    }

That method should refer to the enum's instead of doing integer comparisons.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

These constants pre-date the move to support only JDK 1.5+ (as of Ehcache 1.6.0).  They will probably not be converted to an enum as that would be a breaking change.  At some future point we may make a release that fixes a number of API issues like this.

Internally, getStatisticsAccuracyDescription should also use the statics.
