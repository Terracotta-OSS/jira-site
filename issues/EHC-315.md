## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This patch adds notifyElementSerialized (when an element is written from memory to disk) and notifyElementDeerialized (when an element is read from disk into memory) to CacheEventListener's.  Useful for reattaching the object to some context when the context does not get serialized. 

Includes unit test.

Assigning these issues to Greg, so that he can decide what to do with them.

Adding this will make the population of listeners out there incompatible.  This is a narrow use case. Java already provides hooks with readResolve.
