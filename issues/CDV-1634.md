Below was the solution offered by the forum user.

"I believe I have resolved this issue for my particular case. I am using a new CacheKey class as the key object in my cache. For some reason, it does not like when the key object has .equals overridden. I removed the .equals, and it works okay now. Not really a big deal because I can still implement Comparable in the CacheKey class, and it still works. No idea how I stumbled upon that fix. Just luck I guess!"

This code has all been replaced in Vicente at pretty much every level.  If you want to reopen this as a 2.6.x issue then thats fine - but it's not applicable for Vicente.
