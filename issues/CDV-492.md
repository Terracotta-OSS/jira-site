## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have got another problem. 
I conficured a terracotta server custer running in active passive-mode over network. My server machines are linux based. 
When using Java 5 everyting works fine, in fact starting the first node the message I get is the following: 

2007-10-30 14:38:53,446 INFO - Configuration loaded from the file at '/opt/tc-config.xml'. 
2007-10-30 14:38:53,496 INFO - Log file: '/var/log/terracotta/server-logs/terracotta-server.log'. 
2007-10-30 14:38:54,453 INFO - JMX Server started. Authentication OFF - Available at URL[service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9520/jmxrmi] 
Oct 30, 2007 2:38:55 PM org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.ReceiverBase bind 
INFO: Receiver Server Socket bound to:/172.42.1.151:9530 
2007-10-30 14:39:00,880 INFO - Becoming State[ ACTIVE-COORDINATOR ] 
2007-10-30 14:39:00,985 INFO - Terracotta Server has started up as ACTIVE node on port 9510 successfully, and is now ready for work. 

On the other hand, using java 1.4. Both nodes come up as active. 

The message I get stating the first node is the following: 

2007-10-30 14:43:48,153 INFO - Configuration loaded from the file at '/opt/tc-config.xml'. 
2007-10-30 14:43:48,211 INFO - Log file: '/var/log/terracotta/server-logs/terracotta-server.log'. 
2007-10-30 14:43:49,836 INFO - JMX Server started. Authentication OFF - Available at URL[service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9520/jmxrmi] 
2007-10-30 14:43:56,996 INFO - Becoming State[ ACTIVE-COORDINATOR ] 
2007-10-30 14:43:57,151 INFO - Terracotta Server has started up as ACTIVE node on port 9510 successfully, and is now ready for work. 

Note that the message: 

Oct 30, 2007 2:38:55 PM org.apache.catalina.tribes.transport.ReceiverBase bind 
INFO: Receiver Server Socket bound to:/172.42.1.151:9530 

is missing now and trying to execute the command: 

netstat -na 

no socket appears to be listenining on the port 9530, so the packet sent by other node is rejected (I saw that sniffing packet on the other node). 
Of course no problem for me using java 1.5, but how come terracotta server cluster doesn't work proberly with java 1.4? 

The distribution I've used is Red hat enterprise 3, but I've got the same problem even using CentOS final 4.3.

Is or is not the server and tools only supported under 1.5?  I thought we only supported 1.4 for the client.
