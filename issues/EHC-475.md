## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Replace the pop-up with some kind of indicator of the server disconnection inline of the web page.  Lots of options for that - text, icon, color, etc.  But make the popup go away as it's annoying.

Might want to have some way to try to reconnect to later on.

I used the best icon I could find in my licensed icon collection. It's not optimal, but if something better is needed please send it to me.

verified. Get a red-colored cross icon when connection goes away.
