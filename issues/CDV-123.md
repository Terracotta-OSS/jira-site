## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It's not known if this case is actually handled correctly. Here's the scenario...

Start with an unshared collection instance (eg. LinkedList). Create an iterator off of it. Refence the linked list from some shared object (thus making the list a shared object). Mutate the list through the previously created iterator. This mutation should be reflected in the distributed version of the list. 

This needs to be tested for all iterator views (values, entrySet, keySet, Iterator and ListIterator) and for all the various mutator methods exposed on the various iterator views.
