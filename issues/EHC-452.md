## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The shutdown hook code looks like it could be cleaned up a bit.  There is a synchronized(this) that occurs on the shutdown hook thread and serves no purpose here:

            Thread localShutdownHook = new Thread() {
                @Override
                public void run() {
                    synchronized (this) {
                        if (status.equals(Status.STATUS\1ALIVE)) {
                            // clear shutdown hook reference to prevent
                            // removeShutdownHook to remove it during shutdown
                            shutdownHook = null;

                            if (LOG.isLoggable(Level.INFO)) {
                                LOG.log(Level.INFO, "VM shutting down with the CacheManager still active. Calling shutdown.");
                            }
                            shutdown();
                        }
                    }
                }
            };

It also seems like the removal of the shutdown hook to prevent memory leaks could be handled by not using an inner class and possibly using a WeakReference back to the CacheManager.

perhaps that logic is better suited for a synchronized method back on the enclosing cachemanager instance?

Is this still even an issue?

the particular synchronization mentioned is stupid and serves no purpose (other than to confuse the reader). Beyond that it doesn't hurt. 

I don't have any particular motivation to take up the task of replacing this shutdown hook with something based on weak references
