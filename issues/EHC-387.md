## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Write the following tests against standalone (in ehcache-1.7-tc/terracotta/system-tests):

- Clustered cache with FIFO policy -> should throw exception
- Clustered cache <terracotta/> with no <terracottaConfig> -> should throw exception
- Clustered cache with <terracottaConfig url="path/to/tc-config.xml"/>
- Clustered cache with <terracottaConfig><tc-config>...</tc-config></terracottaConfig>
- Clustered cache, no name specified for CacheManager (no name attribute for <ehcache>) - EHC-361
- Cache manager with both clustered and unclustered caches
- Clustered cache (<terracotta>) and either overflowToDisk="true" or diskPersistent="true" in the <cache> config -> should throw error - EHC-382
- Using both clustered cache and replicated cache setup should throw error - EHC-381
- Clustered cache but no <terracottaConfig> -> should throw error
- Clustered cache, <terracottaConfig> but no standalone jar -> should throw error
- <terracotta clustered="false"> - verify cache is unclustered
- <terracotta valueMode="identity"> -> should throw error
- <terracottaConfig> with both url="" and <tc-config> subelement -> should throw error (need one or the other)

All the listed tests are now implemented - two are currently still timebombed while awaiting dev fixes to make them pass.  Timebombs will expire 28-09-09...
