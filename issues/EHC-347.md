## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.BlockingCache.getKeysNoDuplicateCheck()
does not delegate to its decorated cache instance, but
simply calls itself which results in an infinitely
recursive loop and a blown call stack.  I made the
change to have it delegate to the decorated cache
instance instead.

Yessssss. This problem is basically caused by poor test coverage in BlockingCache. It does subclass CacheTest, but was not creating BlockingCaches for test, but Caches. I 
have fixed that and that should stop other silly bugs like this getting through.

Thanks for your report. The fix is in trunk and will be in ehcache-1.2.4.
