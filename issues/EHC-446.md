## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

MemoryStore does this:

        map = new ConcurrentHashMap(maximumSize, DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR, CONCURRENCY_LEVEL);

expecting the map to be sized sufficiently to hold maximumSize (according to the Javadoc).  However, it will resize once you reach maximumSize\*DEFAULT\_LOAD\_FACTOR (assuming uniform hashing).  Would be better to size it initially to maximumSize / DEFAULT\_LOAD\_FACTOR.  CHM will actually bump that up to the next 2^n due to its hash function.  And an unlucky hash situation can still cause buckets to need a resize separately, but can't imagine that's worth worrying about.

Anyhow, would recommend changing to:

        map = new ConcurrentHashMap(maximumSize / DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR, DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR, CONCURRENCY_LEVEL);
    
and drop a comment about the rationale by this formula.
