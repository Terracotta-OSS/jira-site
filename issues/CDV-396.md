## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Really we'll need to experiment with this to make sure it's a good idea but my theory is that our greedy locks are too fair. If a lock is recalled by the server the local lock manager should probably at that point see how many local waiters it has for the lock and either service as many as it can in some period of time or use another technique in order to reduce ping ponging in a highly concurrent world.
