The verification didn't seem to take user specified boot jar classes into account. 

If tc-config.xml says java.util.Locale should be in the boot jar, but it is not at runtime, the user will get an error as such.

If one was expecting the boot jar to be automagically remade any time a relevant config change is made, that is another issue. The script only checks whether a boot jar of the correct name exists, the verification happens when the app is launched.

The boot jar verifier checks both ways, basically it (should) trigger if the contents of the tc-config.xml's additional-boot-jar-classes section is not in sync with the contents of the bootjar at all (the ones marked foreign) --- I'm taking it, I'm the one who last worked on that feature.

- Still need to merge in trunk
- Also make sure it works in Windows: check for side-effects on scripts that uses the boot-jar-path scripts and dso-env
