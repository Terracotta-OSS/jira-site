I was able to modify tc-maven-plugin to support express mode by default (bootjar only created in custom mode)

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Verified with Terracotta 3.2.2, as of 20100527-070529 (Revision 15357 by cruise@su10mo4 from 3.2),
for custom mode: ran the tc-maven-plugin plugin which creates the bootjar as expected.
Ran the session cart (express mode), ran the sample using mvn tc:start bootjar is not created as expected.
