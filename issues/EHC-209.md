## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It would be helpful to have RMICachePeer report the cache involved in a remote operation.

Right now, let's say we receive a bunch of remote removeAll commands, we can't know for which cache it applies!!!
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote removeAll received
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote removeAll received
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote removeAll received
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote removeAll received
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote removeAll received
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote removeAll received

The remote remove entry is slighly better, providing the key, but not the cache again:
DEBUG RMICachePeer - Remote remove received for key: C$LABELGRP$
