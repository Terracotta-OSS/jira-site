## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The values are of course objects and we don't want to send or have classes to actually look at the values, so the two possibilities are:

1) Use toString() - this puts it under user control and guarantees a string that we can send.  One downside is we have no control over how big these are and user could easily kill the system (unintentionally) with huge strings.  We could cap each value string to a max length however to protect against that.  Also, that max length could even be changeable in the ui if we passed it with the request.

2) Use reflection - we could analyze a value object graph by reflection and dump the entire graph to a string.  There are some possible Java security issues with that and it probably wouldn't work perfectly in all environments, but would work regardless of whether the user had defined useful toString()s.  

Could possibly make both 1 and 2 a dynamic choice as well.

There's an another option here which is to allow structural renderers to be registered for specific type. I'm thinking along the lines of what we're doing in the regular dev console where we display different kind of maps as easy-to-use trees and not just a reflection-based hierarchies. This seems much more useful to me.
