## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Add additional support to the Ehcache and/or Hibernate and/or new mbeans as necessary to support features needed by the Terracotta Dev Console equivalent to prior support with Hibernate Terracotta Second Level Cache.

This is a little vague as I don't know the full list of gaps, but some examples:
- dynamic config change methods (TTI, TTL, max memory, max total count)
- latencies (implement or drop depending on time and difficulty)

Other missing gaps, need to decide which ones we are going to support (which ones makes sense?):

- Eviction statistics enable/disable: This is already present for ehcache (cache.getLiveCacheStatistics().getEvictedCount()). Need to decide if we need dynamic enabling/disabling for this.
- Enable/Disable region cache. Not sure what this would mean for EhcacheProvider. Need to think how to do this if we decide to support this one.
- Region cache logging. Dynamic enable/disable. need to figure out what to actually enable/disable
- Enable/Disable region cache orphan eviction dynamically.
- Dynamically change orphan eviction period.
- Flush behaviors on cache enable/disable per cache, setting values and changing dynamically:
        - flush on disable
        - flush on enable
        - no flush on both enable/disable

Verified with 3.2.1-ee RC 4
- dynamic config change methods (TTI, TTL, max memory, max total count) 
- statistics enable/disable
- Enable/Disable region cache
- Region cache logging

Missing. 
- latency
- orphan eviction
- Flush behaviors on cache enable/disable per cache, setting values and changing dynamically:
        - flush on disable
        - flush on enable
        - no flush on both enable/disable 

As per Abhishek, it was decided to not to support missing features.
