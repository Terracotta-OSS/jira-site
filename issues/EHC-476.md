<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Thus in cache managers tab nothing needs to change, but in other tabs where the cache managers available (actually currently the probes) are listed the drop down, this should be fully qualified by adding the cacheManagerName to the string.

In my example I have 2 probes
129.168.1.1:3456 
129.168.1.1:3457

The cache managers are called 
CM1
CM2

Thus for example in the pull down on the stats page I currently see
All
129.168.1.1:3456 
129.168.1.1:3457

The desired visualization is
All  
129.168.1.1:3456:CM1
129.168.1.1:3457:CM2

This should appear in all tabs where a cache manager drop down is available. Also in the config tab when all is selected, the cachemanager name should be shown in the exploded lists

Note: If the cachemanager is unnamed, you will see an object ID for the name. 
net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager@125124
In this case the package name should be truncated and 
CacheManager@125124
used

I've got a version of this locally, but I'm not convinced that the second colon separator for the cache manager name is such a good idea. 

Maybe it's better to put it in between brackets to make it easier to identify visually:
129.168.1.1:3456 (CM1)

as opposed to
129.168.1.1:3456:CM1 

Also keep in mind that probes might be named, resulting into:
This is my probe:CM1

or:
This is my probe (CM1)

Committed with the colon separator, adapting for brackets isn't much work at all, if needed.

Verified in rev 5534, the dropdowns show probeName:cacheManagerName. Probe names can be the name given in the probe or <probe-ip>:<probe-port>
