## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

While doing configuration tests, I ran into a strange parsing issue which was not referenced on the web. Not a very important one, but I wanted to give it back to the community.

Terracotta 3.5.2 provides a "/ehcache/ehcache.xsd" file which defines a "localCacheEnabled" for the <terracotta> tag (this tag is backed by the net.sf.ehcache.config.TerracottaConfiguration Java class). When having a Terracotta configuration such as <terracotta localCacheEnabled="false"/> in ehcache.xml, the following exception is raised:
Code:

 org.xml.sax.SAXException: null:586: Element <terracotta> does not allow attribute "localCacheEnabled".



The problem is that Terracotta 3.5.2 packages EhCache 2.4.3 for which the TerracottaConfiguration class does not have a "localCacheEnabled" field. (this field is defined in EhCache 2.5.0). EhCache 2.4.3 ehcache.xsd does not include the localCacheEnabled, so this seems to a packaging issue in Terracotta 3.5.2 : the ehcache.xsd from the trunk may be provided instead of the one from EhCache 2.4.3.

The workaround was to replace <TERRACOTTA\1INSTALL\1DIR>/ehcache/ehcache.xsd by the one from EhCache 2.4.3.

Note: the same issue occurs in Terracotta 3.5.1, which packages EhCache 2.4.2.

Assigning to infrastructure, looks like a packaging issue. The ehcache.xsd for ehcache-2.4.3 tag does not have the attribute too.
