## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This change allows the
BlockingCache/BlockingCacheManager and their subclasses
to specify the CacheManager to use when creating their
backing caches.  

In the current version, users of BlockingCache or
SelfPopulatingCache are forced to use the CacheManager
returned by  CacheManager.create().  This works fine in
basic usage, but if you need multiple CacheManagers or
if you want to specify a configuration file manually,
you cannot use the constructs. 

This change allows the user to pass a CacheManager in
to the BlockingCacheManager class, which is then
propagated down to the BlockingCache class, which uses
the provided CacheManager instead of the default one to
create the cache. 

The .zip file attached contains the 6 modified source
files, all from net/sf/ehcache/constructs/blocking

Thanks!

Scott,


Sorry about the delay in processing this one. ehcache-constructs is my own 
little collection of caching applications that I don't update all that often, 
compared with the ehcache core.

I have applied your patch and written some unit tests to test it. 

ehcache-1.2 now allows multiple CacheManagers per VM, without needing to 
resort to separate classloaders or other tricks. Given that is the case it makes 
sense to let ehcache-constructs use constructor dependency injection rather 
than resorting to a Singleton approach to resolve the dependency.

Thanks for your patch! It is in trunk and will be in ehcache-constructs .7
