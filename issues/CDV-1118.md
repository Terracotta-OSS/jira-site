## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1766.page:

Un-selecting the box in the admin console seems to have no effect (at least pre 2.7.3, with the latest version is hard to say unless debugging the process or watching the network, as this is the last version :o)

It seems to me that AdminClientPanel.java:728 should be
if (isEnabled() && m\_updateCheckerControlAction.isUpdateCheckEnabled())

</div>

I'm pretty sure this is by design.  It was the quick way to make the  admin console always check.  The pref should be removed probably.  I recommend we review this for quintara as part of the always-on nature of the update checker.
