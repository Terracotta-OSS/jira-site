## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If the \*value\* is not serializable it throws an exception as expected but the message is misleading.

It says
"Consider using Element#getObjectKey()"

but it should say
"Consider using Element#getObjectValue()"

</div>

Yep, simple error there. I have fixed it in trunk and it will be out in 2.3.
