## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

On adding cache with TTI/TTL = 30, the configuration tab shows the correct values for cache. But in content tab, elements show TTI/TTL = 0, which should be 30. The expiration time is also not shown for them.

</div>

Are you sure that you didn't set Eternal to true in the cache?
