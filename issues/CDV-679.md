## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The admin console runtime stats feature is too aggressive.  It should only auto-start graphs one time.  Thereafter, the user should be in control.

Steps:
1. Start server
2.  Start admin console
3.  Click runtime stats for the server
4.  Press the "pause" button
5.  Click on another tree node to go away from the runtime stats
6. Click runtime stats for the server

Expected:
- Graphs remain paused

Actual:
- Graphs start again

</div>

Tested with Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev7861, as of 20080401-190405 (Revision 7861 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.6), it is working as expected.

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample application launcher
3. Launch the sharededitor demo
4. Launch the admin console
5. In the admin console, expand the Terracotta cluster tree | Servers | ipaddress:port and select the Runtime statistics
6. click the "pause" button on the right pane and verify that all the statistics are stopped
7. In the admin console, click on the Clients 
8. Then again, click on the Server runtime stats

Expected: Graphs to be remain paused
Actual: Graphs remain paused as expected
