## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We have discussed the feature to publish forge sites from branches, instead of trunk, when there is a pending branch. 

As of now, if I look at the docs on the forge site for collections:

http://forge.terracotta.org/projects/tim-collections/docs/quickstart.html

then as a naive user I would assume I should use a version of 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT, however this is incorrect, the latest version that is working that should be used is on the branch, 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT

Our discussion yielded this:
- Publish the site from from the latest release (tagged with the values "release-\*")
- If there is no release, publish from trunk
- If you want to publish from a specific edition (tag or branch) you must specify it via the terracotta.forge file (this is because we can't just assume/deduce which one is a pending branch)

Should we override all of the projects that we own in the Forge to publish using a certain branch?

Updated the forge publisher configuration to use the correct branch for site publication.
Some projects are not yet branched so they will still publish from trunk.
