## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We've got NullPointerException in the MulticastReceiverThread.processRmiUrls method when accessing processingThreadPool. It's caused by wrong initialization of the processingThreadPool and receiverThread fields, since the processingThreadPool is initialized after the receiverThread is started.

Regards,
Taras.
