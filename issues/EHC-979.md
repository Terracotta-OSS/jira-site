## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

java.util.concurrent.atomic.Atomic\*FieldUpdater should fit a couple of usages.
... even though some changes might be a little challenging (i.e. ConcurrentHashMap.\*tabAt)

The motivation for this is partly to help with osgi deployments I think (correct me if wrong). When using things in packages like sun.misc.\* (like Unsafe) I think you need extra configuration for using ehcache in osgi. It'd be nice to not bother end users with this. 

There is also the argument of not relying on internal oracle apis, but for Unsafe I don't think that is a strong point.

osgi can probably be extended to any SecurityManage'd environment though... 
I think ehcache standalone would just work fine in these... until now
