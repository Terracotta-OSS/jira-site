## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

User using 2.6.2 and had an old tc.properties that references some 2.6.1 module. What we got in that situation is only a NullpointerException with no useful info to help detect this. It took too much time to debug in the dark.

We need more logging.

It is not safe to add the default modules in the tc.properties file because module versions are changing for each release.

Tested with Terracotta 2.7.0-stable0, as of 20080728-210703 (Revision 9506 by cruise@WXPMO0 from 2.7), got better logging info.
But  the log should specify the root-cause of the problem (i.e, about tc.properties file)


Steps:
1. Install the kit
2. copy the old tc-properties under /install-root/lib
3. Launch the session configurator and start the TC server and tomcat5.5

Actual: Tomcat failed to start 

Here is the output:

2008-07-29 12:25:06,296 FATAL - Unable to resolve dependency TIM: excludes-config version 2.6.0.SNAPSHOT (group-id: org.terracotta.modules) 

   Attempted to resolve the TIM using the following descriptors:

      groupId: org.terracotta.modules
      name   : excludes-config
      Version: 2.6.0.SNAPSHOT

   Expected the TIM's filename to be:

      excludes-config-2.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

   Expected these attributes to be in the manifest:

      Bundle-SymbolicName: org.terracotta.modules.excludes-config
      Bundle-Version     : 2.6.0.SNAPSHOT

   Searched using the following repositories:

      + C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-2.7.0-stable0\modules
      
   Tried to resolve the jar file using the following paths:

      + C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-2.7.0-stable0\modules\org\terracotta\modules\excludes-config\2.6.0-SNAPSHOT\excludes-config-2.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
      + C:\Program Files\Terracotta\terracotta-2.7.0-stable0\modules\excludes-config-2.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
      
   The following shows the dependencies path the resolver took and why it needed to locate the missing TIM:

      excludes-config version 2.6.0-SNAPSHOT (group-id: org.terracotta.modules, file: excludes-config-2.6.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)

   If the jar file exists and is in one of the paths listed above, make sure that the Bundle-SymbolicName and
   Bundle-Version attribute in its manifest matches the ones that the resolver expects.

   If you do not have this particular TIM or any of its dependencies installed, try using the tim-get tool's 
   'install' command:

      C:\> tim-get.bat install excludes-config 2.6.0.SNAPSHOT org.terracotta.modules

   You can also use the tool's 'list' command to see if it's actually available:

      C:\> tim-get.bat list excludes-config   # list anything that has 'excludes-config' in it's name
      C:\> tim-get.bat list                   # or, list everything that is available

   For more information on how to use the tim-get tool, invoke:

      C:\> tim-get.bat help

Messaging is clearer in 2.7 and no NPE!
