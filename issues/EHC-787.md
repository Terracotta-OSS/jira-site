## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It will be great to have LICENSE.txt placed in jar file for open source ehcache products.
Many other open source projects do it: file LICENSE.txt is be placed in META-INF directory.

WE use Apache 2. Hung can you make sure the name of the license is in the manifest?
We dont' need the full license in there.

where can I find this LICENSE.txt file? There's currently no file with that name in Ehcache-core-kit, only the EHACHE-CORE-LICENSE.txt found here http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/ehcache/trunk/core/src/assemble/

</div>

Just in the manifest put
License: Apache 2.0 
We do not need the license file
