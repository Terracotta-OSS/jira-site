## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

All of the code refers to Mutex a class from Doug Lea's library. It has now been replaced with Sync.

All usages use LockType.WRITE. READ is never used.

Starting at line 464 there is also commented out code. That should be deleted or uncommented, as the case may be.

</div>

I'll address the JavaDoc issue, as for the commented code and the READ lock, see EHC-420
