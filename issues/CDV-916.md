## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/docs/Get+The+Snapshot+Visualization+Tool explains how to download SVT for 2.7 but not for the previous versions. It would be nice to have a link to the page for SVT 2.6.x.

Thanks,

Sylvain

Use http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/orgsite/Get+Snapshot+Visualization+Tool
This is the URL which is referenced in 2.6.x builds when you select "view" from the admin console
