## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Currently ehcache can only be configured with its own pool:

{noformat}
statisticsExecutor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(
          Integer.getInteger("net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.statisticsExecutor.poolSize", 1) ,
{noformat}

I all my app I have already a pool instantiated for similar purposes that I would like to be able to reuse...

Ability to provide some way to provide own thread pool would be welcome.
