## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From pete@goodtech.co.uk

As far as I can see, this behaviour in Cache.class

put(Element element, boolean doNotNotifyCacheReplicators)

...

if (elementExists) {
  element.updateUpdateStatistics();
} else {
  applyDefaultsToElementWithoutLifespanSet(element);
}

memoryStore.put(element);

}

means that the following documentation sample just
doesn't work:

http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/samples.html

Update an element in a cache. Even though cache.put()
is used, ehcache knows there is an existing element,
and considers the put an update for the purpose of
notifying cache listeners.

Cache cache = manager.getCache("sampleCache1");
cache.put(new Element("key1", "value1");
//This updates the entry for "key1"
cache.put(new Element("key1", "value2");

On the first call of put
applyDefaultsToElementWithoutLifespanSet will write the
ttl and tti values into the element being placed in the
cache. On the second call, those values won't be copied
in, but the newly created element will overwrite the
old one in the cache. As far as I can see, this means
an object has been created that won't expire.
