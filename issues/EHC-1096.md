## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We enabled indexing for search in ehcache accordingly to instruction here
http://ehcache.org/documentation/2.8/apis/search

This means that we set  allowDynamicIndexing="true" and added DynamicAttributesExtractor. 

But after that we did some tests and checked perfomance. As we found the performance decreased. The search time increased in 4 times.

Debug showed that DynamicAttributesExtractor called not only once (before put or update as said in docs) but also every time during search for every object.
It absolutely not clear what is wrong and how DynamicAttributesExtractor may help with quick search if it decreases permfomance.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

This is an unfortunate consequence of search being implemented in a brute force way in OpenSource Ehcache. This means that attributes have to be extracted when search queries run.

The [implementation and performance|http://ehcache.org/documentation/2.8/apis/search#implementation-and-performance] section of the documentation indicates that OpenSource Ehcache has no indexing capabilities.
