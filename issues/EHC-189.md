## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The javadocs for Cache.remove and Ehcache.remove state:

  Also notifies the CacheEventListener after the element was removed,
  but only if an Element with the key actually existed.

However, this is incorrect, as notifications are sent to listeners
even if the element didn't exist (lines 1378 - 1381 of Cache.java).
