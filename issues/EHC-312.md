## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This patch allows applications that use regular JDK collections to use EhCache without much fuss. Provides implementations of Map, Set, as well as two Queue implementations (FIFO and a hybrid PriorityDelayQueue).

We had been using the Map and Set implementations internally for quite some time, and recently we've come across the need for a Queue implementation using EhCache as a backing mechanism. We reviewed Sam Goldberg's queue patch at https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2776716&group\1id=93232&atid=603561, and although good in practice, it did not meet our requirement (i.e. it does not implement JDK Queue and only FIFO is supported). Our implementation supports arbitrary orderings which are maintained across VM restarts. The base AbstractEhCacheQueue implements most of the scaffolding, and concrete subclasses provide template method implementations to deal with the different ordering schemes.

The package also contains a few wrappers and interfaces to make it easier to work with generics instead of raw types.
