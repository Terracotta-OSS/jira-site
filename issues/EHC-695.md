## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It is very difficult to test at the boundries of where my (client) code and ehcache (api) code meet.  CacheManager is not an interface so to mock it out client code needs to make a proxy interface to the CacheManager methods used.  Same goes for SelfPopulatingCache.

The worst is CacheConfiguration.  You can't proxy it with cglib because the methods you care about are all final.  EasyMockExtensions fail because some of the methods call things internally which cause null pointer exceptions.  e.g., "setMaxElementsInMemory":
   java.lang.NullPointerException
        at net.sf.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration.fireMemoryCapacityChanged(CacheConfiguration.java:1319)
        at net.sf.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration.setMaxElementsInMemory(CacheConfiguration.java:397)
        at ...

right now we are prioritizing backward compatibility which would make this difficult.

I think this is a style thing rather than a real need. JCache also has a concrete CacheManager. You can use getEhcache which is an interface if you want to use decorators or mock out a cache.
