My gut tells me that most of the internals for the implementations of these classes don't have directly [useful] translations to DSO. The semantics of volatile reads, and compareAndSwap operations are the part of the magic here. 

It seems that we need to preserve the semantics that this type documents, but the implementation will probably be completely custom for dso. 

LOE: 2-4 weeks

This was added as a major priority, yet it has been around since 2007.  What are the plans for this.  Without a suitable alternative, this is possibly a show stopper for my project.  I don't see any estimations of what version this will be included in.
