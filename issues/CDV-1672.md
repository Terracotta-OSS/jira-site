## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I am using Quartz scheduler, I don't see any table maintaining/persisting Jobs that are trigger and run by Quartz scheduler. Seems once the Job is successful, it is getting deleted. I see a business need for organization using this quartz for jobs run history in the tables, so that if required clients can develop UI around the history and provide browse facility to users/admins for their jobs executed.

In one of my old product, we have our own scheduler framework and we have this facility and I saw good value add in it.

I am interested to contribute for it as well.
