## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The pom.xml for EhCache has the following property for the terracotta version: 
<ehcache-terracotta.version>$\{project.version\}</ehcache-terracotta.version>

This causes issues in newer versions of EhCache since there is no equivalent terratcotta version. For instance, the pom.xml for EhCache 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 causes maven to look for terracotta 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 which do not exist

We had a bug in those versions of the poms. It has since been fixed. To work around,

please add TC maven repo in your pom to pull the 
ehcache-terracotta jar. However, if you're not using clustered ehcache, you 
could just use the ehcache-core artifact instead of the ehcache (which 
is a wrapper for ehcache-core and ehcache-terracotta)
