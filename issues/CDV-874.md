## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The JMX connection URL created by the AdminConsole replaces the passed in server hostname with the actual host addresss.  This bypasses ssh tunneling.  It's a simple fix to just use the user-specified server host when creating the JMX connection URL.
