## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory allows a port to be configured;
unfortunately, contrary to what the docs in the ehcache.xml seem to
indicate, this does not configure the port the peer listens on, but
instead only configures the port the rmi-registry listens on. The port
the peer listens on is not configurable and is assigned a random port
(line 60 of RMICachePeer, first parameter to super()), preventing this
from working through firewalls.

In short, we'd like to be able to configure the peer-listener port
too.
