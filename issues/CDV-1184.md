## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Add this to the many known bugs with logical subclasses (at least those that add state and switch the class adapter to do the delegate thing). 

In this instance the methods on Clearable (if present in the logical superclass) are not delegated in the subclass.

In GenericMapTest.testClearable() the test should only care about "instanceof Clearable", but it can't since it fails on this like the inner MyHashMap type due to this bug
