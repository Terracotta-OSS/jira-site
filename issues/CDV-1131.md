## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since we decided to not fix CDV-1078, this item is to make sure that Sessions still gets fixed to the point where it doesn't suffer from lock holding issues as sessions are faulted.

The solution might be using ConcurrentStringMap underneath sessions, but that is not necessarily mandated. Fixing the issue is mandated :-)
