## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Some customers have asked that we insure they be able to use Wily tools, specifically Intrscope, to monitor applications running under TC. Wily uses byte-code weaving in their product(s). This would at least be a new test, and perhaps some engineering, as Wily tools are widely used and will surface at other customers as well.

The primary purpose of this Jira is to put this on the table for us to look at, test, understand, and plan accordingly vis-a-vis our product and the customers who are asking for the compatibilty.
