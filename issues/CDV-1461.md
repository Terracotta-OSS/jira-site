## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

After enabling/disabling stats a few times, the enable/disable stats button gets into a broken state.

Restarting the TDC does not correct this issue.  After this state is reached, it is not possible to use the button any longer.  

For example, it seems that stats are disabled - however the button believes they are enabled.  Therefore the button only gives me the option to disable stats - but since they already are, it seems the command to disable them is ignored.

Might be somewhat related to CDV-1455? delays in wait time make things look broken?
