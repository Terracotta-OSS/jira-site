Great product!!!
We are planning to evaluate this product at Lehman 
Brothers vis-a-vis GemStone and Tangosol.

We would need a feature like disk backup whereby all 
the cache data is backed out to disk. Diskoverflow 
would backup is I set maxElementsInMemory=1, but all 
the reads would be from disk. 
Is there a feature whereby all the cache is backed upto 
disk, plus I can retain some elements in memory.

Thx.

Venkat,

Not sure which way you went. Ehcache added persistent DiskStores 18 months 
ago in ehcache-1.1. Ehcache-1.2 adds the ability to persist to disk at any time 
using Cache.flush().
