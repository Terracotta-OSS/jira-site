## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/2225.page#13205


http://www.terracotta.org/web/display/orgsite/Configuring+Terracotta section "Configure a root" reads "Notice the roots section, which identifies the map field to be a root in the Main class"

There is no "map" field in the configuration. There is only "Main.instance".
