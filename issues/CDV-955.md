## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Clients are identified by client ids now and channel id is old way of identifying clients. Admin client still lists the column as channel id.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

With Active Active it makes more sense to identify clients with client ids since there may be more than one channel established to the server.
