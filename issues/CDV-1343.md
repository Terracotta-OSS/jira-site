## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need to add docs to DistributedCache page that both tim-distributed-cache and tim-concurrent-collections are required on the runtime classpath.  Currently neither of these is mentioned, but you will get normal ClassNotFound type errors if you don't include them.
