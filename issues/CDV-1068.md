## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It came up recently that when using Spring, the config of <session-support>true</session-support> + the <jee-application> is identical to the non-Spring <web-application>.  Might be nice to clean up this redundancy at some future point.

Verified with 3.1, it is removed from the config of spring as expected
<jee-application>
<session-support>true</session-support>
<jee-application>

</div>
