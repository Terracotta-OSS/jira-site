## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Terracotta currently supports versions v1 and v2 of Glassfish. There is a version v2.1 that has been out for a while and I'm fairly certain it does not start when terracotta is in the mix and using the tim-glassfish-v2 module. 

This is one problem report (there have been others though I don't have any links):

I left him a comment giving the oppurtunity to give us a patch. I don't have any indication that is up to that task, but it never hurts to ask
