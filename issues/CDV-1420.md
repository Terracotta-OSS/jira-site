## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I did a fair amount of this in Rivera but there are still features that are being used in the DistributedCacheImpl implementation that are not exposed in DistributedCache.  For example, the eviction stats are not part of the public API.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

in particular I think any protected variable being done in subclasses across TIMs is questionable

This is not urgent, but please assess what (if anything) should be done here.  I think a lot of possible issues have already been resolved for other reasons since this was filed.

Yes, but its not urgent in my opinion and should probably be handled as part of the SPI work....

I don't think we're doing exactly this, but the creation of the toolkit and getting type closure in it should cover the original intent
