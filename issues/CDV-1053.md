## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

addClassResource() uses URL.equals() to compare URLs but this method actually does domain name resolution and blocks, so is a bad thing to rely on.  See:  http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html

On severity, I don't see any obvious place where this method is actually used, so might be able to just remove it.

That method I think might be used from TIMs that do class exporting. I think only jar or file type URLs would really be passed here in reality, but it would be good to clean up the interface to make the issue impossible

If this can be done in 20mins or less go ahead.

Need to check whether this is used by any  tims in the forge before removing.  That's unlikely but possible...if it is being used, please update this jira with that info so we can reassess.

This method is used in TerracottaConfiguratorModule

  protected final void addExportedBundleClass(final Bundle bundle, final String classname,
                                              final boolean targetSystemLoaderOnly) {
    String url = getBundleJarUrl(bundle) + ByteCodeUtil.classNameToFileName(classname);
    try {
      configHelper.addClassResource(classname, new URL(url), targetSystemLoaderOnly);
    } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException("Unexpected error while constructing the URL '" + url + "'", e);
    }
  }

which is under module-base project.

Are we still trying to delete it then? or trying to work around the URL.equals() call by converting the URL to String then compare that?

converted URL to String before doing the comparision

    if ((prev != null) && (!prev.getResource().toString().equals(resource.toString()))) {
      // we want to know if modules more than one module is trying to export the same class
      throw new AssertionError("Attempting to replace mapping for " + className + ", from " + prev + " to " + resource);
    }
