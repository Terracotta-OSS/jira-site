## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hello...is there anyway we can disable the setThreadName method from being called? 
 
When a "get" call to a UpdatingSelfPopulatingCache or SelfPopulatingCache is called many times, the setThreadName seems to cause delays based on our JProfiler HotSpot report: 
 
java.lang.Thread.setName 5,463 ms (0 %) 0  
0.2% - 3,133 ms - 0 hot spot inv. net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.SelfPopulatingCache.setThreadName 
0.1% - 2,330 ms - 0 hot spot inv. net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.UpdatingSelfPopulatingCache.get 
 
Any other ideas on how I can shave off these 5 seconds when retrieving objects from ehCache?
