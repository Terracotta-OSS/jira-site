## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

ReentrantLock and ReentrantReadWriteLock both have constructors that let an application decide if they want a fair or non-fair lock policy (the default is non-fair),

The terracotta instrumentation changes this and always forces the fair policy no matter what the application passes on the constructor.

For non-shared locks instances, this seems pretty odd (especially since we're forcing the non-default)

This behavior has actually caused failures in the monkeys, as we use the instrumented forced fair RRWL in the L1 code, it actually caused a deadlock in the new lock manager code, I'm going to code a workaround for the lock manager, but I'm very keen on seeing this fixed.

For the record the failures are due to this known "bug" (or bad specification) in the JDK 1.5 RRWL:
