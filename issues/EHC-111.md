## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi,

I've the following configuration:

<ehcache>
    <defaultCache maxElementsInMemory="100"
                  eternal="false"
                  timeToIdleSeconds="120"
                  timeToLiveSeconds="120"
                  overflowToDisk="false"
                  memoryStoreEvictionPolicy="LRU" />
</ehcache>

All my caches are created programmatically from the
default configuration. On the created caches, I
register a CacheEventListener through the
RegisteredEventListeners obtained via
Cache#getCacheEventNotificationService().

Each time my listener is called, the cache instance
passed to the invoked method is incorrect, it is always
the default cache instance.

I've debugged the CacheManager#addCache(String) method
and found that the Cache#clone method uses Object#clone
which do not deep clone references to other objects.
Well in this case, the instance of my cache shares the
RegisteredEventListeners reference with the default
cache instance. This is clearly wrong as
RegisteredEventListeners as a back reference to Cache.

As a work around, I'll have to create the caches myself
using the Cache constructor.

Thank you!
