## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

OSCache supports a non blocking cache: Only one requesting thread needs to update an expired cache entry even if multiple threads are requesting it simultaneously. Other threads can be configured to either receive the recently-expired object, or block until the cached object is updated. In a high load environment the delivery of recently-expired objects can provide enormous performance benefits.
