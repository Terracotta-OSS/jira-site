## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I don't have a \*strong\* opinion about it, but some people get confused at the asymmetry between our exception throwing policy: we throw an exception when you try to mutate a shared object without a shared lock, but we don't throw an exception when you try to read a shared object without a shared lock.  Perhaps we should make this behavior symmetrical.

I'm not really in favor of it, but another way of making it symmertrical would be not throw exceptions on writes. I guess this would effectively mean that we could commit these writes whenever we saw fit.

We should add this and make it optional - as well as allow writes to be optional (according w/Steve).

This could have a big performance impact.
