## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi, 

we get a NPE when creating a new cache.

I looks like the Bug is in this Method:
String[] net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.getCacheNames() throws IllegalStateException

--- snip ---
 String[] list = new String[ehcaches.size()];
        return ehcaches.keySet().toArray(list); //when the Array.length > the keyset: there are null values in the result! We think that the ehcaches content changes between this lines!
--- snip --- 





full stacktrace:

Hi Dirk can you please give us a few more details about your use case?
i.e. how you're creating the caches and why you think that the ehcache content would change (e.g. are a lot of clients creating many caches at once?)
Any sample code/reproducible case showing the null cache names would be very helpful in figuring out exactly what is happening here.

Hi,

we had one cacheManager.

At runtime we create much caches and remove them.
With many threads in a webapp!

1. creating the manager (singel)
manager =  net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager.create();


2. often creating
-- creating a cache --
ehCache = new Cache(new CacheConfiguration(this.cacheName, cacheSize).overflowToDisk(false).eternal(true));
manager.addCache(ehCache);


3. remove
manager.removeCache(cacheName);


4. everytime 
Using the cache...

In general I would not recommend accessing a CacheManager from multiple threads without some form of external locking.  Although some of the data structures used internally are safe against concurrent access/mutation the class as a whole is not tested in this way, and is not imho intended to be used in this way.

Is this "fixed" or "as designed"?

It's fixed - as in this precise NPE should not happen any more.  I still stand by my statement however that the CacheManager isn't really intended for multi-threaded use like this.
