## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

EHCache's ShutdownHook cleanup conflicts with the JBoss/Hibernate ShutdownHook.
This is causing unnecessary Exceptions to be thrown whenever JBoss/Hibernate using EHCache is shut down.

For details, see:
http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread\1id=1624868&forum\1id=322278

Due to Hibernate's less than optimal (IMHO) exception handling in SessionFactoryImpl.close, this could cause Hibernate's ConnectionProvider not to be closed. (so it's potentially more damaging than just spurious warnings showing up in the logs)

This issue has been highlighted on Hibernate's forums here:
http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=968632

As a simple fix, could EHCache's ShutdownHook be optionally disabled?

Thanks
