## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I think there are two problems in here. The more severe is the actual NPE that happens in the classadapter, and as such this should be assigned to someone on transparency team. 

The class adapter will try to dereference the super class of Object, which will be null, geting an NPE.

I got myself into this situation since I marked an Object variable as a root using the eclipse plugin. In theory we could exclude Object in this case, but that isn't truly necessary to special case
