## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/6265.page

Usually the default 1024 limit on boolean clauses is more than sufficient for any reasonable query. Using in() however it isn't too hard to imagine exceeding the limit.

This item is to allow one to configure the limit. The minimum would be to expose this a tc.property

Don't know for sure but using a TermsFilter could be of use here? This is a message from the lucene mailing list that could apply to this problem.

I would recommend to use TermsFilter (http://goo.gl/BC9eQ, possibly wrapped
by a ConstantScoreQuery). You must do the query building by hand, yuery
\*parser\* cannot do that:

TermsFilter tf = new TermsFilter(); // it is in lucene-queries.jar
tf.addTerm(new Term("id", val1));
tf.addTerm(new Term("id", val2));
tf.addTerm(new Term("id", val3));
tf.addTerm(new Term("id", val4));
// if you need a query and don't want to use a Filter:
Query wrappedQ = new ConstantScoreQuery(tf);

You can execute the Filter as addon to your already prepared query:

searcher.search(queryParser.parse("content: (hello world)"), filter,...);

Or you use the wrapped as ConstantScore and combine it with the query:

BooleanQuery bq = new BooleanQuery();
bq.add(queryParser.parse("content: (hello world)"),
BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
bq.add(wrapped, BooleanClause.Occur.MUST);
searcher.search(bq,...);

1024,

Don't think I can commit to this by TP2/Vicente code freeze.
