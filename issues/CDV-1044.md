I had a hackfest Friday night and got this pretty far along.  I've basically put together a CHM + a simplified version of the eviction logic from Ehcache.  One nice effect was that I was able to isolate the evictor from the map with just a simple EvictableMap interface.

Thus, the storage map is separated from the eviction and also to some degree from how expiration is defined.  This is still in flux a bit but so far that seems like a promising design split (storage, eviction, expiration).

This has been added to the forge in tim-map-evictor.  It consists of:

1) An Evictor that works on something implementing a relatively simple Evictable interface. The Evictor handles both TTI and TTL (or both or neither) style eviction.  It is a rip off of our Ehcache evictor and is designed to be tolerant in the face of some or all L1 node crashes and also to minimize faulting during eviction.
2) A DistributedMap interface that is basically like a Map (but doesn't formally implement the interface).  Will talk more about this.
3) An implementation of DistributedMap that marries a CHM and the Evictor to give you a very basic cache where items can expire.  

This implementation is now being used in the Examinator for user registration codes, password reset codes, and the exam cache.
