## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If the terracotta.xml inside of a config module is not correct, there seems to be no errors which is pretty hard to track down.

If there terracotta.xml in a module is bad, an error should be thrown (preferably to the console, but at a minimum to the logs)

</div>

Seems a warning was logged in the client logs, I also now added a warning that's printed out to the console logs so that the user can immediately spot it.

Something that should be decided is the error message that should be shown on the console. Currently, it's the same as in the logs, ie. a small explanation of what was going on and what the config bundle was, and then the exception message and stack trace. I was thinking that on the console it was maybe not needed to have the stack trace, just the explanation, bundle name and exception message should be enough for users, no?
