So you'd like this to be happening, disregarding if the CVT is actually running or not?

Tested with Terracotta trunk-nightly-rev9063, as of 20080707-210708 (Revision 9063 by cruise@WXPMO0 from trunk), the heap stats are logged for every 15 minutes as expected.

Steps:

1. Install the kit
2. Launch the sample application launcher
3. Launch the shared editor demo
4. Launch the admin console


Actual: Heap stats are logged by default into terracotta-server.log
