What should it do? I prints out:
Couldn't register with the dashboard master at address 192.1.1.23 and port 9080
... then here's the stack trace ...

seems that the stack trace is important information here to indicate the reason?

My opinion is that stack traces are for when the software is broken. A message saying that it's trying to connect tot he server and failing at hostname x with port y and retrying is all that is necessary.
