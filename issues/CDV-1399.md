## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

After not finding any good functional SysV startup scripts for \1nix based systems, I put together a chkconfig compatible startup script that could be useful to include in future releases / packages of your system (it has been heavily based on the tomcat startup scripts that are included in tomcat rpms).

I did have to make 1 small change to the start-tc-server.sh script to save the PID for the server if passed as an environment variable.

I am hoping that these scripts can be useful for others as well.

Would you be willing to sign a contributor agreement and put these on the wiki or the forge?

Sure.  Although no idea what your contributor agreement is, but as far as I am concerned, I listed these in the forums already and would be more than happy to see you include them in a future release to make things easier for all.

Let me know what is required.

I just signed the contributor agreement and emailed it to the address specified in the agreeemnt.

Let me know if you need me to do/sign anything additional for this.

Thanks,

These scripts will allow users to start and stop Terracotta using the traditional UNIX daemon mechanisms.  I've reviewed the scripts and they appear to do as advertised.

We now need to decide whether and how to package these scripts with the Terracotta kit.

Another option that Jason mentioned would be having the scripts as a download

Can we put these scripts on the Forge?
