## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

EHCache should be enhanced to support dynamic cluster membership when a static list of peers is defined.  By this I mean that the list of peer nodes would continue to be specified in advance (as is done today), but EHCache would be able to dynamically determine which of those peers is reachable at a specific point in time, and only distribute cache events to peers which are reachable.

The current non-multicast clustering logic, which assumes that every peer is reachable at all times, is too simplistic for most real world applications.

Resilient behaviour with manual peers got added. This should have been closed sooner.
