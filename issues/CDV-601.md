## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Follow the instruction from this page http://forge.terracotta.org/projects/tim-archetype/docs/quickstart.html and create the "baztim" module. Upon running the "sample" in that project, you'll get a bunch of warnings like below:

tc-config.xml

    <modules>
      <repository>file://%(user.home)/.m2/repository</repository>
      <module name="baztim" version="1.0.0" group-id="org.foo.bar"/>
    </modules>

Error:

[INFO] [node0] 2008-01-15 16:45:41,875 WARN - Unable to resolve repository location, verify that it exists and that it is a valid repository: 'd:\Users\hhuynh\.m2\repository\org\terracotta\modules'

A windows file path like this is not a valid url - it may be that this is only a problem on Windows.  Due to the jira (DEV-1176) which I just worked on in 2.5.1, you will likely get a different error message that is a bit more precise.

It has something to do with the module resolver assuming/scanning  <repoloc>/org/terracotta/modules.

I tried this in linux:

    <modules>
      <!-- <repository>file://%(user.home)/.m2/repository</repository> -->
      <repository>file:///export1/cruise/forge/baztim/target</repository>                                                                  
      <module name="baztim" version="1.0.0" group-id="org.foo.bar"/>                                                                       
    </modules>  

and got this error:


[INFO] [node0] 2008-01-15 18:41:00,808 WARN - Unable to resolve repository location, verify that it exists and that it is a valid repository: '/export1/cruise/forge/baztim/target/org/terracotta/modules'

and I have the TIM jar in "target"

[cruise@su10mo9: target]$ pwd

This is just a warning. We should just log this and not print it out.

When a module is not found, the modules loader will complain and print out a list of repository locations where it attempted to find the offending module.

This was misfiled under FORGE; the fix is on the main product line.
Fixed in rev 6846 (2.5 branch), merged in trunk (rev 6847)
