## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When setting the .diskStorePath using the Configuration builder pattern, it ehcache refuses to set a String like "c:\\something\\temp" and always falls back to the default value: java.io.tmpdir 

Possible WA is to tweak the java.io.tmpdir property via overriding the ENV VAR 'TMP' & 'TEMP' on windows system to a valid folder path. WA is not tested on Linux.

Setting the index file path to a valid folder should be possible via an instance of the class: net.sf.ehcache.config.CacheConfiguration

This wasn't a bug, as the JavaDoc on the class mentioned...
You can now set a per Cache path, rather than using the CacheManager's default one, but you need to watch out for collisions!
