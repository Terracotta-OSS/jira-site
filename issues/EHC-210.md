## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

According to the javadocs cache.removeQuiet() should "Remove an Element from the Cache, without notifying listeners".

It seems that listeners are anyway notified also when this method is used (notifyElementRemoved is called).
The last check in Cache.remove() always calls listeners without considering the notifyListeners parameters:

=====
        //If we are trying to remove an element which does not exist locally, we should still notify so that
        //cluster invalidations work.
        if (!expiry && !removeNotified) {
            Element syntheticElement = new Element(key, null);
            registeredEventListeners.notifyElementRemoved(syntheticElement, doNotNotifyCacheReplicators);
        }
=====

(net.sf.ehcache.Cache.java line 1401 - ehcache 1.6-b3)

should probably be:

        if (notifyListeners && !expiry && !removeNotified) {
