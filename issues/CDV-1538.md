## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Values stored in TerracottaDistributedCaches do not have their last accessed timestamps updated on every access in order to avoid creating huge numbers of small write transactions.  Instead we optimize to only update the timestamp when the value is halfway to expiry.  Currently the measure for "halfway to expiry" is based on the cache's configured TTI, and not on the value's TTI.  This means values with custom TTI's will have their timestamps updated at the wrong frequency.  In some cases this can lead to values being expired from the cache despite having been hit since their custom TTI is less than half the cache's TTI.
