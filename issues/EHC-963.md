## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have attached my Spring configuration and EhCache configuration to this issue.
It appears that when RMISynchronousCacheReplicator is used, the following exception is received:


```
2012-08-06 12:56:45,238 ERROR [net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator] - <Exception on flushing of replication queue: null. Continuing...>
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMISynchronousCacheReplicator.listRemoteCachePeers(RMISynchronousCacheReplicator.java:335)
        at net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.writeReplicationQueue(RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.java:312)
        at net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.replicationThreadMain(RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.java:127)
        at net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.access$000(RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.java:58)
        at net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator$ReplicationThread.run(RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator.java:389)
```


If I switch to the RMIAsynchronousCacheReplicator, the issue "seems" to go away. I do still receive the exception, but my app is able to proceed. 

What am I doing wrong? Appreciate the assistance.

Just a little bit more digging on my side:



```
static List<CachePeer> listRemoteCachePeers(Ehcache cache) {
  CacheManagerPeerProvider provider = cache.getCacheManager().getCacheManagerPeerProvider("RMI");
  return provider.listRemoteCachePeers(cache);
}
```


It appears that for whatever reason, "provider" turns on to be null at line 335. Cant quite figure out why because my configuration is similar to the samples. 
I have tried the following environments for the application I use:

- JDK 6/7
- Tomcat 6/7

I should also clarify that the same exception stack appears on EhCache 2.5.0 and above.

More info: noticed that if change to this line, setting the value to false:


```<constructor-arg name="replicateRemovals" value="false"/>```


I no longer get the error. "true" however produces the same stack.

Producing this error as part of a unit test, I have two that attempt to execute delete operations. With replicateRemovals=true, I noticed that if use the following block in my pom, the error would go away for the test:


```
<build>
  	<plugins>
	  	<plugin>
	        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	        <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
	        <configuration>
	        	<forkMode>always</forkMode>
	        </configuration>
	      </plugin>
  	</plugins>
  </build>
```


Hopefully, this should hint at something. 

P.S: other plugin settings are retrieved from the parent pom.

I have a sneaking suspicion considering the kinds of things that "fix" the issue here that this is some kind of race in Spring setting up the Caches/CacheManager.  Of course without a reproducible test case this could take a lot of effort to debug.
