## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The user noticed unrequested locks in his app: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1399.page

This happens because the Swing models use named locks and the guimodels-config TIM is loaded by default.

The guimodels-config and spring-config TIM's shouldn't be loaded by default but instead be explicitly listed in the config files where needed, such as the related demos.
