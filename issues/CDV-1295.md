## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This feature would augment the existing install command.   It would additionally update a tc-config.xml to add the newly installed module into the tc-config.xml.

Here are suggestions for the syntax:

1) $ tim-get install --update tc-config.xml tim-weblogic-10
2) $ tim-get install --add-to tc-config.xml tim-weblogic-10
3) $ tim-get add-to tc-config.xml tim-weblogic-10

I think I am partial to making it available as #2 and #3.
