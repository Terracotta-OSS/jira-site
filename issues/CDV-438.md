## Description

See http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/0/180.page#2716

I am not sure this is really correct, but I wanted to make sure we don't lose the issue in case it is real.  If we do not indeed have a prebuilt jar file available for this my guess would be because it is still in the Forge / Labs.  If so, we need to either:

1. have a process for posting pre-built downloads to the labs just to make those projects easier to consume by the community
2. OR promote JBossCache replacement up into the actual core product / config module land because SEVERAL people are using it.

Needs to become a project and then move into the forge.
