## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">


Im having the exact same issue.  I cannot and probably should not redo the logic behind how hibernate names it caches with packageName.className.  
 
Is there another work around?
 
Thanks

We should at the least improve the efficiency of the compression so that we can increase the number of caches.

When I first reported I did not mention I'm on 1.4.1... It would be nice if the fix could be written in a way that could be backported. 

While better compression can buy us some time, I wonder how far it will go... Are you thinking on using bzip2 perhaps?

We currently have 146 caches, and the urls for each vary from 60 to 105 characters. 

I think we would probably add up to 20 within a year... I certainly will be more mindful of adding caches. In my case these translate to db tables (via hibernate).  I never thought my long package names and class names would end up making me pay this way... 

I understand that 1500 bytes is the MTU for Ethernet, but not knowing the internals of Ehcache and the multicast heartbeat, I can only wish that It could cope with datagram fragmentation if someone exceeds the MTU.

In any case, I really appreciate your help!

Hello,

we currently face the same problem during development of one project.

Though that hardcoded limit is quite nasty thing there appear to be some options.

If you take a look at the following:
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/html/performance.html#performance-cache-mapping
you'll see that you can actually define the region attribute for each cache entry in Hibernate and this should be used as the cache name then. So switching from default class names to some short names here should do the trick. We haven't got into the stage of trying that as we've got another tasks to do first, but I believe it should really be it.

Another option related to the first one might be that it should be also possible to share one cache region among several Hibernate cache entries, so if you consolidate all your caches into some logical groups (read-only, read-write, type of data cached, roughly estimated cache sizes, lifetimes, whatever...) it should reduce the amount of actual caches so the heartbeat packet would be even smaller.
Again, we haven't tried this one yet as well so I can't tell whether this really works (and safely enough).

Also, you may specify which caches would be replicated and which not in ehcache.xml - but I agree that for high amount of these caches (which is the case here) it may be pretty difficult task, not talking about the resulting "mess" in ehcache.xml

Abhishek, I know Greg has some thoughts on this one, so please follow up with him on the direction to go with this.

Fixed. Payload will be broken up into multiple payloads if it exceeds the MTU.

Peter H. Thanks a lot for the info on a good workaround!

Abhishek: Those are great news!   I will try to back port it to 1.4.1 in December. We were able to avoid the limit by eliminating a few unused entities, but will hit it again for sure in a couple of months if we don't apply a fix...

Thanks to all!

I have successfully back-ported the fix it to 1.4.1 

Thanks to all!
