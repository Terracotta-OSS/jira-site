## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Could we enable a simple mechanism in the Terracotta drop down menu from the Eclipse Plugin where a user could enter / file a bug?  Maybe a simple dialog with a Summary line and a Description line, and pressing submit would send an email to JIRA.

</div>
