## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I would like my application server (tomcat) to manage my CacheManager instead of managing it directly in my application. I like to do it that way because a CacheManager often needs access to disk to persist data and I prefer such external resources to be managed and configured at the server level.

As attachment, a simple CacheManagerObjectFactory.

Hi, I sent my Contributor Agreement 3 months ago and didn't see anything since then. So I was wondering if you received it or if you needed something else?
