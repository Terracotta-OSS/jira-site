## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In debugging an issue with Geert, noticed that DSOClientConfigHelper has an addModule(String name, String version) method to add a module dependency but here name is taken as the artifactId and there is no way to specify the optional groupId.  Thus only modules in default org.terracotta.modules group can be added programmatically.  This can be an issue for third-party system tests that need to use programmatic config to test a tim outside our default namespace.  

All support exists internally, just need to expose a new method here:  addModule(String groupId, String artifactId, String version).

Added new method and unit test that it works in ModulesLoaderTest.  Fixed in 2.7 branch (post 2.7.0 release) and trunk.
