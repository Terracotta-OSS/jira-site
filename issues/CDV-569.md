## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When using Spring in a default Tomcat webapp (ROOT), TC Spring doesn't properly determine the application name because com.tcspring.ApplicationHelper assumes a webapp classloader name will end with a non-empty context-path.  When the ROOT webapp is used the context-path is empty and it mistakenly sets appName to the classloader name's prefix, such as "Tomcat.shared."

The workaround is to either not use a default webapp, but rather give it a non-empty context-path, or specify the wildcard jee-application name="\1".

Made fix in ApplicationHelper, created unit tests ApplicationHelperTest.  Also tested by hand using tomcat, TC spring, Eclipse debugger - I would still like to create an automated system test around this issue.

A test would be nice. Can you check with Scott to see if he needs anything from the monkey side?  Or is it just his time:) thanks
