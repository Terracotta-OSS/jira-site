## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

As far as I know, the only hibernate sample we have is the one Taylor cooked up for the hibernate webcast last year.  While that's good for a presentation, it's not really set up to be run by the unexperienced user.

We need a hibernate sample application to ship with the kit alongside all of the other samples.  If this already exists, then please ignore.
