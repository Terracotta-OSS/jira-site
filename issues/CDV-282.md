I believe it means adding the dso-spring module to the web-opensource.def.yml file.  This can easily be done but I'd like to better understand how people use the Spring stuff in the plugin. If we're to really support Spring in the plugin, I think we need ways to add application-contexts, pick out spring beans listed therein, and set the various spring-specific config elements related to those contexts and beans.
