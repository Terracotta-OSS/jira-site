## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Cache loader calls load method asynchronously in a different thread. 

In my case, the loaderArgument passed in getWithLoader(Object key, CacheLoader loader, Object loaderArgument) method can't be used in a different thread (from the one in which it was created). 

Is there a way to configure cache loader factory such that above method (and all related methods) are invoked synchronously in same thread?
