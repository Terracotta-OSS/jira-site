ClusteredLock createLock(Object monitor,
                         LockType type)
                         throws IllegalArgumentException,
                                NullPointerException

    Create a clustered lock around the supplied clustered monitor object.

    The supplied lock type controls the lock hold acquired by the default Lock inherited methods.

    If the supplied monitor object is null then NullPointerException is thrown. If it is not clustered then IllegalArgumentException is thrown.

    Parameters:
        monitor - clustered object
        type - default lock hold type 
    Returns:
        a clustered lock
