## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The change made in rev 20575 for /tim-concurrent-collections/src/main/java/org/terracotta/collections/ConcurrentDistributedMapDso.java has a slight issue in it. 

When the exception handling is called from the path of unlockedPut(), it is possible that the value restored in the store isn't quite the correct one (in the face of concurrent puts on the same key). 

The following is the email thread documenting all known discussion on the matter:

I think this should still be cleaned up. unlockedPut() is still kinda wrong and in general this handling should be completely redone such that we never even make the local mutation in the face of non-portable errors (rather fix it after the fact like the code does now).

Does this issue affect express in any way?

I don't think this affects express since we shouldn't be dealing with non-portable types ever in that context.

This is a sub-task of DEV-5391, but cannot be made one since it is in a separate project.

CDM is going to be deprecated so this will not be fixed.
