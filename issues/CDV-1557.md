## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Setting the version on an element is squashed when the element is put into a clustered cache. It is replaced by the element creation time.

The version policy was changed in ehcache core 2.4.0 (EHC-765) so the clustered store should honor whatever is set by the user
