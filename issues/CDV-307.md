## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Steps to reproduce:

1.  Start configurator
2.  If the "Terracotta Sessions enabled" box is checked, uncheck and restart configurator.
3.  Observe the 3rd window on the right.  Check "Terracotta Sessions enabled" box, then uncheck it.  The state in the 3rd window (and the monitor button) is different after checking and unchecking vs. the startup state.

Expected behavior:
The state of the application is the same (indicates disabled) when started up
