## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I changed the no-arg constructor of ClassAdapterTestTarget to have a synch block in it. That has the effect of creating more than more exit path from the method. 

ClassAdapterTest runs a case (testNamedLockInInstanceManagedConstructor) where a named lock is applied to this constructor. And you get

   java.lang.VerifyError: (class: com/tctest/ClassAdapterTestTarget, method: <init> signature: ()V) Unable to pop operand off an empty stack

This is something a regular user can do. It is not specific to test code or anything
