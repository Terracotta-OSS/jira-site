## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The counters in here are all defined as longs and are read/written w/o local synchronization.  In many but not all cases, the mutator calls are held (in calls above) by the put() synchronization.  But probably better to just make counters atomics or something if you expect them to be right.
