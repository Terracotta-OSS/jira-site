## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I actually don't know what is wrong yet, but running this code where "array" is a managed array, you'll get an IllegalMonitorStateException. 

    String[] array = new String[5]; 

    try {
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        System.err.println(i + ": " + array[i]);
      }
    } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException ia) {
      System.err.println("caught exception");
    }

This appears to be the VM checking the balance of lock acquires/releases made a thread within the context of method invocation

We are causing a violation to rule (1) from the VM spec (http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jvms/second\1edition/html/Threads.doc.html#22500):

Implementations of the Java virtual machine are permitted but not required to enforce both of the following two rules guaranteeing structured locking.

Let T be a thread and L be a lock. Then:

   1. The number of lock operations performed by T on L during a method invocation must equal the number of unlock operations performed by T on L during the method invocation whether the method invocation completes normally or abruptly.

   2. At no point during a method invocation may the number of unlock operations performed by T on L since the method invocation exceed the number of lock operations performed by T on L since the method invocation.
