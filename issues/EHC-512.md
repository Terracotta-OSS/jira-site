## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In addition to saving the list of stats fields (columns) a user has selected into their cookie, I would really like it if it remembered the order and sizing of each field (in my usage example I stretched  the length of one of the fields - i used long strings and I added a  couple of fields and wanted them at the end of the list - I'd lke that all saved).

Currently the cookie is set to expire after 7 days, I don't think the cookie needs to expire

Size of probe/cache (1st column) is not remembered in the cookie. they get reset when browser is restarted.

Cookie are still set to expire after 7 days. Is this expected.

Verified the behavior is expected. First column resize is feature of ExtJS. Created a new jira for cookie expiry time.
