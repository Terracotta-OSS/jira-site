## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I may not have this issue completely correct in my head, but...

When a spring bean is declared to be clustered and contains transient fields, dso-spring will overlay the transient fields from the local bean instance to the distributed one. It appears that spring might be invoking initialization methods before this transient copying occurs. 

We should figure out if this is really true, see if there is anything to do about if so, or perhaps just document it.
