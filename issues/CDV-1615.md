The second of those forum posts has specific instructions for creating an OSGi bundle with Ehcache, at least for SpringDM server, although these could probably be extrapolated to other technologies. Some of the Ehcache/Terracotta JAR names may change in future releases, so it's important to note exactly what's in the Terracotta kit being used.
