## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The JVM property tc.node-name changes the object name of the ClusterBean. This causes problems e.g for the ClusterBeanRegistrationListener that can be found in the jmx-utils project. This listener expects a cluster bean name of "org.terracotta:type=Terracotta Cluster,name=Terracotta Cluster Bean" and cannot find the bean if its name is something like "org.terracotta:clients=Clients,node-name=node1,type=Terracotta Cluster,name=Terracotta Cluster Bean". Probably the node name property should not affect the object name of the cluster bean.

The statistics buffer couldn't be opened at 
'/Users/rdizmang/Terra/terracotta-2.7.0-nightly-rev10005-ee/samples/pojo/jtable/statistics-10.0.0.116'.
The CVT system will not be active for this node.

A common reason for this is that you're launching several Terracotta L1
clients on the same machine. The default directory for the statistics buffer
uses the IP address of the machine that it runs on as the identifier.
When several clients are being executed on the same machine, a typical solution
to properly separate these directories is by using a JVM property at startup
that is unique for each client.

For example:
  dso-java.sh -Dtc.node-name=node1 your.main.Class

You can then adapt the tc-config.xml file so that this JVM property is picked
up when the statistics directory is configured by using %(tc.node-name) in the
statistics path.

Just changing the error message to read -Dtc.node=node1 would make it much less likely that folks would be using -Dtc.node-name=node1.  I would suggest that as a first fix.  

Then, we should document the behavior of -Dtc.node-name=node1 as changing the bean name.  This might well be useful in specific deployment situations.
