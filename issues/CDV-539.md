## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From IRC:

octoberdan: orionl: hello
[10:07am] orionl: octoberdan: hi.
[10:07am] orionl: octoberdan: what's the problem you're seeing?
[10:08am] octoberdan: I have a terracotta application that works with Eclipses 2.4-stable1 version of Terracotta, but hangs with 2.4.8
[10:08am] octoberdan: Oh, eureka!
[10:09am] octoberdan: It will hang on dso-env, dso-java, and dso-make-boot-jar, /if/ I specify that a module needs to be loaded in the config
[10:10am] octoberdan: autolock-synchronizedcollection-1.0.0
[10:10am] orionl: octoberdan: hmm...
[10:10am] octoberdan: and if I specify my own http repository, I get a NPE
