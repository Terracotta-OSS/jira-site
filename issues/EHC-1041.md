It should be possible to search for word match in a string, and or use regex without crippling allowable regex operators.  Currently the only way to wordmatch is using ilike("\* myword \*") and this requires all strings to start with space in position 1.  It would be nice if full regex was supported even though it can be a full index scan.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The example given by the reporter is not actually accurate. \{\{ilike("\* myword \*")\}\} does not require the string to start with a space. It only requires that there is a substring \{\{" myword "\}\} anywhere in the string.

I personally think this is a case of a user misreading the docs. We do not support regex expressions, but using substring search with wildcards is supported. Although using leading wildcards is not recommended for performance reasons, but that is a separate issue.
