## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If one sets that tc.property I would expect it force session cookies to never be set "secure". Unfortunately only specifying true there will have any effect. The code really needs to handle 3 cases:

  1) no property specified -- default to cookie secure to request.isSecure()
  2) property is set to true -- cookie is always secure
  3) property is set to false -- cookie is NEVER secure 

Case (3) is currently the only thing broken

The jira said fix in "3.3 and trunk" but I'm not sure if that is still applied here. Fix currently in trunk only.
