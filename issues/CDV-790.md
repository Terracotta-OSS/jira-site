## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums
 System is working for a while, then suddenly UnlockedSharedObjectException appears. I know It's mean changes without lock aquiring. But it's thrown from Ehcache code so locking should be created by Ehcache integration module. Also it works well aproximately 6 hours before exceptions.

This issue was not reproducible with the latest hibernate tim
( tim-hibernate-3.2.5-1.1.0 ). The cause of the issue seemed to be a bug in
older clustered-hibernate module that was used

I actually think this could be resolved unless we want to look at the older hibernate version.
