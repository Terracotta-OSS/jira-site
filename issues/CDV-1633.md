## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Seems like calls to putAll(Collection<Element>) will always result in notifyElementPut notifications and not notifyElementUpdate.

A note explaining how this works will appear in http://ehcache.org/documentation/get-started/consistency-options.

However, most of the documentation that mentions putAll() refers to the API documentation for specifics, so Javadoc should also be updated.

Can we update the javadocs please?

The javadoc for putAll actually already covered this behavior.  I have however tried to clean up the language so that this aspect of the behavior is clearer.
