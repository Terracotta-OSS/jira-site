## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The CacheLockProvider.lock method (in both of its implementations) has strange behavior.  It silently ignores re-entrant lock requests which obviously causes problems on unlocking.  The weird behavior is in place for BlockingCache.  We should rename the method to reflects its strangeness, and provide a regular lock method as well.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The Sync.lock method now has proper reentrant semantics and BlockingCache now uses a new query method on the Sync instead.
