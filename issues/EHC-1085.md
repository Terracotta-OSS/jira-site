Digging into the code for PayloadUtil it appears the caclulartion is 
\* Wrong - it is set at 1500, but is uses as total payload size, whereas the MTU size includes the payload and any headers that may be in the packet.
\* Hard coded. In various networks, such as virtualized or over a VPN the MTU size may in fact be considerably smaller than the ethernet default of 1500.

Another point on the hardcoding...  it works to the other extreme too.  If you have fiber between your nodes, then the MTU is over 4300.  Forcing fragmentation at 1500 doesn't really have any merit.
