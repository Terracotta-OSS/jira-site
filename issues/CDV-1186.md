## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

it appears that the jboss 4.2.3 integration has changed since "Terracotta 2.7.3, as of 20090129-100125 (Revision 11424 by cruise@su10mo5 from 2.7)"

i have a simple test app that i can setup and run with clustered sessions on jboss 4.2.3 with terracotta 2.7.3. when i start up the same client and point it to the terracotta nightly installation, everything starts up fine, but the sessions don't get clustered.

i'll attach the client logs. the obvious difference is that in the nightly log, there's this:
2009-03-10 11:34:22,195 [main] WARN com.terracottatech.dso - One or more web applications are listed in the Terracotta configuration file, but no container TIMs have been loaded.
See http://www.terracotta.org/tim-warning for more information.

obviously, i went to that url, but i didn't see an obvious answer to solve this problem.

my questions are, is this a planned switch in how the features should work out of the box? if so, will the jboss app server integration documentation be updated to include the extra steps necessary to get things working in the new versions? and, in the meantime, what are those steps?

Mike, yes using 3.0 (Terracotta trunk-nightly, as of 20090309-110315 (Revision 12046 by cruise@su10mo5 from trunk) you will need to add the container tim to the installed version of Terracotta, using tim-get.

2.7.3 will contain the containers.

1 - today, i started with a fresh install of terracotta-trunk-nightly-rev12059

2 - i changed my tc-config.xml to be:

<tc:tc-config xmlns:tc="http://www.terracotta.org/config" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.terracotta.org/schema/terracotta-4.xsd">

        <clients>
                <modules>
                        <module name="tim-jboss-4.2" version="1.0.0-SNAPSHOT" />

		<dso>
			<web-applications>
				<web-application>test</web-application>

is the problem that the module loader's trying to find a file named "modules-base-[1.0.0.SNAPSHOT,1.1.0.SNAPSHOT).jar" ?

thanks for the report, we'll have a look. In the meantime I suggest you use terracotta builds from the 3.0 release line (trunk builds are development snapshots for beyond 3.0 are known to have issues with TIMs). You can get 3.0.0-stable0 TC version from our main download page.

cool, i just tried "Terracotta 3.0.0-stable0, as of 20090306-110324 (Revision 12024 by cruise@su10mo5 from 3.0)" and i did not get the same tim problem. thanks!

also, this next thing didn't effect me (at least not yet or that i realize), but i saw it while installing all of the tims (i tried multiple times and the download failed everytime):

./terracotta-3.0.0-stable0/bin/tim-get.sh install --all
