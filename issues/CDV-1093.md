## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This snippet is from start-tc-server.bat. If there's no JAVA\_HOME defined, it will assume there is a bundle jre in the kit. 
------------
if not defined JAVA\_HOME set JAVA\_HOME="%TC\_INSTALL\_DIR%\jre"
set JAVA\_HOME="%JAVA\_HOME:"=%"
------------


This assumption is wrong since generic kit doesn't have "jre" bundled. Users might prefer generic kits on Windows (due to smaller download size)
