## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Client Object references set is not refreshed immediately.

Hence these objects hence could not be deleted due to capacity eviction.

These objects could be deleted only due to periodic eviction.
Now periodic evictions frequency is twice the dgc frequency.

Default DGC interval = 60 mins
=> Periodic eviction interval = 30 mins

Hence these objects would have been collected after 30 mins. But a system test runs only for 15 mins.

1) ADD another configuration which would define the interval for "Periodic Eviction" since now we might disable "DGC" in a lot of use cases because of "inline DGC".If this property is not defined then we can default it to 1/2 dgc period. By default lets have it work like now, but for system test we could just set periodic interval.

2) In case of periodic eviction first update the client object reference set and then do periodic eviction. Capacity Eviction will continue to use client object reference set which will now be updated on regular intervals or periodic eviction.
