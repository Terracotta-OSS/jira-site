## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

"eternal" attribute in cache element is quite confusing wrt tti/ttl.
Basic confusion is if user sets both tti/ttl and eternal with conflicting values, its not clear which one will override which value.
e.g.
tti/ttl = 10
eternal = true
Will the cache elements have tti/ttl of or elements will never expire as eternal = true?


Actual behavior right now depends on which attribute comes first in the actual config xml. Setting eternal = true resets values of tti/ttl to 0.
<cache name="one"
         maxElementsInMemory="0"
         eternal="true"
         timeToLiveSeconds="15"/>
This cache will have ttl of 15 even if eternal = true as ttl comes later in the config.

For:
<cache name="two"
         maxElementsInMemory="0"
         timeToLiveSeconds="15"
         eternal="true" />
As the eternal attribute comes later here, it will reset the value of ttl to 0 and the cache will not have any ttl and elements will never expire.

Basically we either need to remove/deprecate the eternal attribute (as tti/ttl values of 0 means eternal=true)
Or define when both are specified, one of them always overrides other.

element.getExpirationTime() seems to be broken as well.

In the test ServerMapTTLExpressTest, if you print element.getExpirationTime it will give u Long.MAX\_VALUE
But inline eviction happens if u sleep and then try to access this element.

Exactly.
Returning Long.MAX\_VALUE gives the impression eternal = true and elements will never expire.
Also eviction happens, meaning the ttl is actually effective, regardless of eternal=true.

If ttl is declared before eternal=true in the config, the ttl will be reset to 0 and eviction won't really happen even if ttl=30.

I think we should flag an error if both eternal is set to true and also tti ttl is set to non-zero.

I think we should make sure order doesn't matter in the config and if both eternal is set to true and tti/ttl are > 0 then we flag it as an error instead of silently ignoring tti/ttl.

cheers,
Saravanan

Agree with Saro. If set it should override. Also throw an error on startup if there is a conflict. 
eternal is true should not be deprecated.

Gary Keim raised a good point. There will be people out there with different configs. Why break them unnecessarily?

Indeed a whole bunch of unit tests broke when this change was made. That should have reminded us, as our own unit tests are good examples of config that has been developed over time.

Let's change this to:

1. eternal if set overrides TTI and TTL
2. If eternal is set, and TTI/TTL is set to non-zero values, then emit a warning as follows: Cache name\_of\_cache is set to eternal but also has TTI/TTL set. The TTI/TTL setting will be ignored and the cache will be set to eternal.". Do not throw an exception.

The upshot of this is that the configs will be gradually cleaned up over time.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Allowing both eternal and tti/ttl setting is still confusing. Users have to read the doc to know which one precedes which. And ppl don't look at logs unless there is a problem so silently ignoring some setting might make the cache work in unintended ways. Personally I feel failing fast is always a better approach. But if everyone is having a strong opinion about breaking compatibility with exiting config, then I am ok with the change.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Existing behavior currently is that if eternal=true and tti/ttl is also set, and in the config the tti/ttl comes later in the config, the cache honors the tti/ttl.
Making eternal override TTI/TTL will also break backwards incompatibility (in more subtle manner than the exception actually until user finds and reads doc that eternal now overrides tti/ttl). 

For now, printing a warn log (at console? instead of log files) and not changing any behavior might be better.
Throwing exception/config overhaul (schema validation etc) may come in next major release.

Will revert code to not throw exception on conflicting config values for now.

Cannot get this fixed in 3.3.1
Will have to wait till next major release to fail-fast with exception. Logging warn level msgs for now.

Removed 'doc required' flag. Source 3.5.0-RC product docs now state that eternal="true" in a cache overrides any TTI/TTL settings.

From Manoj. The fix is


When both TTI/TTL and eternal attribute are set, eternal attribute takes the higher precedence. Also, we get a new warning message like below.  The fix is to have this higher precedence and the warning message. We decided not to throw error message as many other places might break.

            LOG.warn("Cache '" + getName() + "' is set to eternal but also has TTI/TTL set. "
                    + " To avoid this warning, clean up the config " + "removing conflicting values of eternal,"
                    + " TTI and TTL. Effective configuration for Cache '" + getName() + "' will be eternal='" + newEternalValue
                    + "', timeToIdleSeconds='0', timeToLiveSeconds='0'.");

If we can't remove eternal, can we at least not make it required?

Never thought it was required. It should be optional.
