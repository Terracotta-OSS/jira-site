## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Values of configuration properties depends on tc.properties default file, custom properties file, system settings and so on. It would be fine if you can see current settings of all properties in "developer console".

Seems like a good idea. Gary what would it take to do this?

Not too much work. A new panel next to the System properties for both server and client, the ability of TCProperties to generate a standard java.util.Properties version of itself, made available via the path DistributedObjectServer->TCServerImpl->TCServerInfoMBean.

And for the client, DistributedObjectClient[TClient]->L1InfoMbean.
