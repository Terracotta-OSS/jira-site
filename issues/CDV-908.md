## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

infact i came across a strange issue,
where two threads have locked same object..
pls see the below jstack, i got

"TP-Processor386" daemon prio=10 tid=0x5de48e20 nid=0x1852 waiting for monitor entry [0x5afba000..0x5afbb570]

while other threads are waiting for this lock

Can you pls look at this, as i feel this is a critical issue.

Can you also tell me which Operating system this is, and what your java command line is (in particular any -XX switches used)?

I'm going to file a bug with Sun about the reporting in the thread dumps. I can reproduce these seemingly incorrect stack traces pretty easily. Even though there are threads that say they both have the lock at the same time, I never see anything hang. Also of note if that you shouldn't ever see two RUNNABLE threads that both hold the lock in the same heap dump

There is a bug in ConcurrentHashMap that makes these ManagerUtil.lookupExistingOrNull() calls much too frequently. Upgrading to 2.6.x of Terracotta will avoid this problem

Thanks for providing the jvm arguments although from what I've found it doesn't look like that information is relevant. 

The reporting of the multiple "- locked <0x64308d40>" in the thread dumps is misleading, but I don't think there is anything to worry about here. There should only ever be one thread that is actually runnable, the other threads will report BLOCKED state. Running a test program I can get the same type of misleading "locked" statement in thread dumps. This happens \1without\1 using Terracotta so if anything this is a sun bug. I have filed a bug with Sun actually but it is yet to be formally accepted in their database. 

On a related notes, terracotta 2.5.2 has a bug in which causes excessive calls into com.tc.object.bytecode.ManagerUtil.lookupExistingOrNull() originating from ConcurrentHashMap. Terracotta 2.6 and greater does not have this issue.

Hi,
    so its good that you are able to reproduce this without Terracotta.
    Can you tell me how did you reproduce that, so that i get some idea..

I attached a program called Lock.java here. Running this program with a 1.6.0 VM on linux should let you observe the threads in unusual state. I tested with 1.6.0\104 and 1.6.0\107 and using a variety of VM switches and they all behaved the same.

No fixed version as this is not a Terracotta Bug.
