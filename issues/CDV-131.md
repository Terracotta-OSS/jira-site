## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We re-implement FutureTask and use adapter to change the package name. The adapter fails to take care of a methodInsn and FutureTask is failing after the fix for DistributedMethodCall.

FutureTaskTest is currently disabled until this issue is fixed.

</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

To fix this problem and to be consistent with the instrumentation for Hashtable and HashMap, FutureTask is refactored. com/tc/util/concurrent/FutureTask is renamed to java/util/concurrent/FutureTaskTC and use instrumentation to change to java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.

FutureTaskTest is enabled.
