## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have an EhCache that is configured as clustered and strongly consistent with a unlocked reads view decorator (see attachment). This cache is loaded by multiple test servers, which in turn are accessed remotely from a test client. What each thread in the test client does is do a (remote) put to one server and then a get (using the same key, naturally) to each server. The value returned from the get is compared the one put. That is, the put and gets are executed in succession. The key includes the thread name to prevent collisions between threads. Note that the value in the put is always non-null.

Since the cache is strongly consistent, I'm expecting that the gets will return the value that was put. However, what I'm seeing is that this is often not the case. In many instances, the value returned is null, implying that the value put was not written to the TSA.

I've re-produced this on both EhCache 2.6.0/Terracotta 3.7.0 and EhCache 2.6.6/Terracotta 3.7.5.
