## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

<beans>
  <bean name="myBean">
    <non-distributed-field>log</non-distributed-field> 
  </bean>
</beans>

If the type of "myBean" is has a class hierarchy where the "log" field is actually in a superclass, the <non-distributed> aspect will not apply.

Eugene says for this that: "we should be registering transient fields from the classhierarchy walker"

</div>

Yeah one could but it makes the tc-config unnecessarily verbose.

Also the documentation creates a certain set of expectations when it says (e.g. in docs\reference.xml):
"Specifies the names of non-distributed field references within a Spring bean instance." And this implementation belies those expectations.
