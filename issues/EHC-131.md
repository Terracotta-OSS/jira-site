## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The diskStorePath parameter specified in Cache's 1.2
constructor is ignored (overwritten with CacheManager's
diskStorePath in addCache).

Workaround:
Subclass Cache and override setDiskStorePath(String)
with an empty implementation.

Fix:
The Cache.setDiskStorePath method should be removed. It
suggests that the path can be set at runtime, which is
not true. Instead of injecting the value from
CacheManager.addCache, Cache.getDiskStorePath should
get the value from CacheManager if Cache.diskStorePath
is null.

This is all a bit untidy and is there only to not break backward compatibility. I 
have updated the JavaDoc to indicate the parameter is ignored.

Eventually I will deprecate these constructors and clean this up.
