## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Max Mem and Max Disk.

The attributes in configuration should use their ehcache.xml labels for clarity and because these are already well known and non ambiguous. Those labels are reproduced below for convenience.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

	maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
	The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

Not sure how much of this is feasible for Brisbane, please update and / or pull subset that isn't feasible into new jira.

I have a problem with using these names in that they are very long while the data is very short. This prevents them from seeing a lot of the config in the columns and either requires manual resizing of the columns, clipping of the headers to make parts of the names invisible, or horizontal scrolling.

What about using shortened names using acronym style with the full names as tool tips? 

e.g.
maxEIM with tool tip maxElementInMemory 
maxEOD with tool tip maxElementsOnDisk
ttlSeconds with tool tip timeToLiveSeconds

</div>

I don't see how 'maxEIM' is clearer than 'Max Mem' or  'maxEOD' is clearer than 'Max Disk', which is what it currently says.

If you start shortening the names they should at least mean something obvious. For instance maxEOD reads like 'maximum end of day' for me. Even when users know 'maxElementsOnDisk', 'maxEOD' doesn't look intuitive imho.
