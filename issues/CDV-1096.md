## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

from http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1687.page#10110

In my jsp page when I include other jsp page with <jsp:include> with terracotta session replication following error is thrown. I am using nightly build from 08/01/2008, which does support jboss version of 4.2.2 according to issue https://jira.terracotta.org/jira/browse/CDV-573

One more observation, which might help you, I tried the same application on Jboss3.2.2 and terracotta 2.7.0. It is working fine there. 

SessionResponse55$ResponseWrapper is terracotta implemented class with catalina package
