## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I don't know if this will happen for anyone else, but I noticed that if I do not have the bootjar for my platform, and I start L2 and sample L1's by hand, I get a bootjar error asking me to create the bootjar.  The samples fail to start.  That's all good and correct.

But, under the launcher, I see logs from the clients starting up. I even get the jtable to start, and I never see the bootjar error that I should.  I only see that the clients are not sharing state.  The admin console then correctly shows no attached L1's or roots.  The strangeness is that I see no errors AND, somehow, the client app starts up whereas at the command line, it fails.

This will surely confuse some people just ramping up on DSO.

The Sample Launcher invokes java directly but the bootjar is determined and check for in the scripts.
In Moraga both the scripts and the Sample Launcher will create the proper bootjar if it doesn't exist.
In the current release, the scripts and launcher use TC\1JAVA\1HOME that is set to the bundled VM.
This problem hits Mac users or those that override TC\1JAVA\1HOME.

Not a problem in Moraga.
