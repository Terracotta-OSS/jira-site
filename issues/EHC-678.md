## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

During testing of EHcache JTA with the Atomikos transaction manager quite a few bugs were discovered in Atomikos' product itself. They fortunately all got fixed in version 3.6.3 which is their very latest release available as of now.

The Atomikos TM is quite popular and very many different versions are out there while only the very latest which only is a few weeks old works fine so I think we should add this fact in the release notes, something like this:

EHCache JTA
Note to Atomikos users: only version 3.6.3 and more recent are supported, older ones contain a few serious bugs which break different parts of EHCache's JTA support.

these jta tm apps may also belong in the 'platform support' page.

i've updated the source for product docs -- maybe we need to verify minimum versions on these others?

Yes, I think we should document the versions we tested against for all transaction managers we do support.

Atomikos: 3.6.3 and higher
BTM: 1.3.3 and higher
(JBossTM: 4.9.0.GA and higher) ignore; we don't officially support JBossTM outside JBoss AS

I don't know about the others.
