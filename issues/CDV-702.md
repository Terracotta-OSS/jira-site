## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Improve error message when Resolver is unable to locate a bundle dependency.

We need to improve the error message for when a bundle dependency is not found. Currently we only list the name of the unresolved bundle, but we do not indicate why we were looking for that bundle. It would help a lot in diagnosing these type of problem if we could at least show the trail of how we ended up looking for a certain bundle by listing the stack of bumdles that led the resolver to look for the problematic/unresolved bundle.

Eg:

Unable to resolve bundle 'foobar-1.0.0', this is required by bundle 'foozoo-1.0.1', which is required by 'fooquux-2.0.0', etc...

(or something like a stacktrace)
