## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When running unclustered ehcache and overflowToDisk=true, the app vm refuses to exit. Seems like threads for executing disk writer tasks are not started in daemon mode.
In DiskStorageFactory constructor:
diskWriter = new ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor(1, new ThreadFactory() \{
            public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
                return new Thread(r, file.getName());
            }
        });

</div>

The original does seem to declare the disk writing thread as a daemon.  In the case of a non-persistent cache I can see how this could be a good idea.  In the case of a persistent cache however you really want the thread to wait until it terminates normally otherwise the persistent cache will almost certainly be corrupt.

I don't remember if i was using diskPersistent true or false, was running an app with auto-generated config. The app refused to exit, and making overflowToDisk=false fixed it.
I don't think I was doing any op on the cache, even if it was persistent, so probably not sure when/how/who created the thread. Will try to post a reproducable sample here.

It seems odd to rely on the threads not being daemon to solve that flush problem

Non-persistent disk stores now have daemon writer threads.

Not able to reproduce in ehcache-core 2.2.0
