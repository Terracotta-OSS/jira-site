## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Spring integration does not work with Spring 2.5. A downgrade of Spring to 2.0.X immediately solves the issue. Unfortunately, we have already standardized at Spring 2.5, and need to be able to move Terracotta to it within the next 3 or so months...

ideally...

Thank you for the information Steven! Good news.
There is still one quetsion open for me: Spring 2.5 has Dynamic Modules which integrates OSGi into spring framework. Does that mean that Terracotta will also support Dynamic Modules and some OSGi implementations? I am asking that question because currently I have some problems with clustering OSGi based application with Terracotta.
