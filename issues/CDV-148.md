## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This would be a stand alone tool that can tell the caller whether everything that should be in the boot-jar for a given config is there. It could also be added to the startup sequence to verify boot-jar and rebuild if necessary instead of just checking for existance and building if necessary.

Did we already do this with boot jar verifier?

Is this related to DEV-116?

There's a new script in bin called: scan-boot-jar; it has the same args as the make-boot-jar script.

It will list all the classes declared in the additional-boot-jar section of a tc-config file but is not included in the specified or default boot jar file.

does it traverse config modules?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

yes it does work with modules.

the list of classes that needs to be added to the bootjar is already complete (ie, it includes the list for each module specified on top of what is in the tc-config.xml file) before the check is done.

we could probably get rid of this extra script file (scan-boot-jar), and just build it in the BootJarTool, to perform the check if bootjar already exists. and we could add a --force option, which will tell it to rebuild the bootjar no matter what the result of the test.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Reassigning to DRB for consideration:
We should get rid of the scan-boot-jar script altogether, and have the check (if the bootjar is complete for a given config) happen before the bootjar tool actually create a boot jar.

Here's how it would work, the bootjar file is created:
- if it doesnt exist
- or if it is incomplete (classes declared in the config is not in the bootjar file)
- or if the user specifies the -w  or --overwrite option

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

This sounds like a great option.  Can you also add an option to scan (or verify) the  contents of the boot jar? like a list option.  
Also make sure that this information is added to help output and documentation.

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I've added a -w option (can also be specified as  --overwrite) 

A boot jar is always created if this option is specified, otherwise:
- it checks if a boot jar exists, if not then it is created
- if it exists, then it checks if it is complete (based on the tc-config.xml) specified - if it isn't, then a new one is created.

Retested with rev 4502, working as expected.

1. Navigate to <install-folder>/bin, execute make-boot-jar.bat  -f ..\samples\pojo\chatter\tc-config.xml 
or execute ./make-boot-jar.sh f ..\samples\pojo\chatter\tc-config.xml 

Actual: Boot jar is recreated succesfully

2. with -w option

Actual: Boot jar is recreated succesfully
