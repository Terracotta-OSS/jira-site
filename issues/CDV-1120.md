## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

See attached screenshots.  

I have 1 root in the clustered heap.  
I run the dev-console which is configured to auto-connect, you can see the first screen that is presented.  
It shows 0 roots (not true).  
Then I click on the object browser.  It then correctly displays 1 root, as shown in the second screen.

This also happens if a client connects and defines a new root.  Until clicking on the Object Browser the new root does not appear.

The steps followed:

1. Started demo-server
2. started two chatter application
3. connect the dev-console and checked "connect automatically"
4. closed all the application, tc server and dev console
5. started demo server and the chatter applications again
6. started dev-console

This time dev-console connects to the server automatically and root count was updated to 1.
