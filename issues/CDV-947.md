## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

There's no reason for the tim-get tool to be tied to the dev/build life-cycle of Terracotta.

We should move its source to the Forge so it can have its own dev/build/release cycles --- this would also allow us to fix bugs in the tool without requiring a release of Terracotta.
