Why did this issue get re-opened?  From my understanding of the request, the locks stats are now not cleared at any time, they are only updated upon a refresh.  I feel this issue can be closed.  Are there any objections?

Lock stats are never cleared until the user refreshes the display.

This is OK.  Refreshing should clear the stats.
