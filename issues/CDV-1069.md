## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

As far as I can tell, when using maven to build and run Terracotta-based apps, sigar is not included at all.  If I look in ~/.m2/repository all I find is tc jars.  No binaries and, as a result, the L1 and L2 will both start w/o sigar present.
 

To reproduce:
1. install examinator from svn
2. run mvn tc:run (after compile and hibernate3:hbm2dll)
3. then download and install 2.7.1 into another directory
4. cd to the installed directory and run bin/admin.sh
5. go to either clients or server runtime stats and it will show an error in place of CPU stats.  

Here's some proof that I am not running JDK 1.6 or some silliness

$ java -version
java version "1.5.0\_16"

$ which java

$ echo $JAVA\_HOME

$ ls -la /usr/bin/java

Applied fixes to trunk and 2.7 branch.  QA please verify.

This still seems broken

Starting admin.sh under either kit, 
connecting to a cluster started with mvn tc:run (in exam/branches/tc-2.7 or exam/tags/release1.0.3)
Host CPU panel shows error message for both server and clients

I think you might have tested against an old version of 2.7.4-SNAPSHOT (which was built a couple days back without Jason's fix)

If you test with examinator/tc-2.7, it's certainly the case.

Test with examinator/trunk, that should be latest.

Hung is correct that 2.7.4-SNAPSHOT doesn't contain my fixes yet.  Once we start publishing nightlies of 2.7.4-SNAPSHOT again the fix will be available.  Until then, the fix is only in trunk/2.8.0-SNAPSHOT
