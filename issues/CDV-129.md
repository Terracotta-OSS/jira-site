Yes, this is just a jmx thing that an external tool can use to ask, are you alive and it can respond.
The first version is strickly a simple response. In the future we will also have it do various diagnostics
like send messages though the internals to make sure nothing is hosed up. The first version to to
tell if a process is hung (i.e. Ctrl Z) or dead or pinned.

I'll be adding a new operation to the existing TCServerInfoMBean.
This operation will be String healthCheck() which returns "OK" if server is fine,
or a more descriptive error message if applicable and/or possible.
JMX clients can call on this operation and check return value to detect problems with L2 server
