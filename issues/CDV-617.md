## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/792.page

Using clustered-hibernate-3.2.5 with the maven plugin doesn't work - it cannot resolve the proper dependencies, as noted by the poster.

Switching to clustered-hibernate-3.1.2 works.

From an e-mail from Taylor:

Based on our discussion here is what I have noticed:

   1. Maven 1.0.3 depends on TC 2.5.0 - so that could cause some discrepencies when specifying modules with 2.5.1 versions
   2. Maven 1.0.4 depends on TC 2.5.1 - the user should use this
   3. clustered-hibernate-3.2.5 in TC 2.5.1 does not have the correct dependency to require cglib-2.1.3 - Jason will fix this for 2.5.2
   4. Building a project with Maven 1.0.4 ends up downloading modules-common 2.5.0 - this is unexpected
   5. Making 2.5.2 will fix the users problem, if the user removes cglib-2.1.3 and updates the pom.xml tc-maven-plugin to 1.0.4
   6. Why didn't tests find that clustered-hibernate-3.2.5 doesn't have the correct dependencies?

The fix for CDV-617 is #3.

I will put in new CDVs for #4 and #6.
