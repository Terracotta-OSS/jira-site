## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We have noticed on a slow connection, and with a lot of data, the lock profiler times out.

Here are the details:

1) Connection to server is relatively slow as it is on a remote WAN link
2) There are a lot of locks in the application
3) Setting stack trace depth to 1, usually results in a somewhat slow, but responsive lock profiler (e.g. hit refresh, get results)
4) Setting stack trace depth to 8, cannot get results from lock profiler.  Once this happens, the lock profiler UI ceases to function in entirety
4a) Setting stack trace depth to 8, cannot get results from lock profiler unless the refresh button is pressed within a very short time.

There is an arbitrary timeout here.  I think the correct solution is to remove the timeout and allow for cancellation.  I'll take a look at what that takes.
