## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It seems that the memory for Mutex objects, once
created is never released. They are put into a Map and
are never removed, since there is no event propagted
from the underlying cache that the key is no longer in
use and that therefore the Mutex could be garbage
collected.

Multiple solutions come into mind: a weak hash map or
something like a LRUMap (see e.g. commons collections).
We would then need a possibility to configure the size
of the LRUMap.

Or we could use the neww Cache Event Listener mechanism.

Any comments?
