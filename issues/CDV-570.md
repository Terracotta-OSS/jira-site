## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The icon on tc-config.xml and TC projects is a red check mark which suggests that there errors due to the red color.

Another color should be picked to make this less confusing.

It would also be good to choose a more distinct TC symbol for indicating a Terracotta file. Why not add the stylized T rectangles on top of the underlying file icon?
