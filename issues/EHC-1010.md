## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Since v2.7.0, methods names in ehcache statistics have been renamed, even if I have not seen this written in the release notes.

The source of the net.sf.ehcache.management.CacheStatistics class has been changed accordingly.
Except that some incorrect methods were used to implement 2 methods in this class.

I think that the following code, in net.sf.ehcache.management.CacheStatistics (v2.7.0), is incorrect:

    public long getCacheMisses() {
        return statistics.cacheHitCount();
    }

    /** {@inheritDoc} */
    public long getInMemoryMisses() {
        return statistics.cacheMissCount();
    }

and that both methods should be rewritten as:

    public long getCacheMisses() {
        return statistics.cacheMissCount();
    }

    /** {@inheritDoc} */
    public long getInMemoryMisses() {
        return statistics.localHeapMissCount();
    }

This was a pair of typos, screwed up in the stats rewrite.
