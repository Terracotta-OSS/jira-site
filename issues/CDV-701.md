## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When the stats subsystem can't startup because the database can't be created, either the StatisticsLocalGathererMBean should be unregistered from the MBeanServer or the startup method should throw an IllegalStateException.

The AdminConsole needs this information to know whether or not to remove the StatsRecorderNode from the tree.

Would an 'active' property provide you with the information you need? If the underlying system failed to initialize, it would be false.

Yes, that would be good.
