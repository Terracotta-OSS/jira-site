## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We'd like to configure auto-locks for all of our methods that are
annotated with a certain annotation.

I.e.:

@MyAnnotationForMethodsThatIWantReadLocksOn
public void foo() {
...
}

and in the config

<autolock>
  <method-expression>something-goes-in-here</method-expression>
  <lock-level>read</lock-level>
</autolock>

But the method-expression lacks the ability to select methods by annotation.

(Even better would be if TC provided its own annotations, eliminating the need for XML, but the above solution is "good enough").

If you can check into this and it doesn't take too long can you do this for FC (6/1)

Fiona, it seems like it is a duplicate of CDV-271. So, we should mark one of them as a duplicate.

This is a dup of 271. It is now working in trunk as well
