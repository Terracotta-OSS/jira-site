Terracotta's jars will need to be placed in a Maven 2 repository in order to easily use Maven plugins that require their use.  Otherwise, it's a real pain to have to install the jars into a local repository by hand and it places undue burden on the user, and they'll just say to heck with it and move on.

The Terracotta jars could be placed on Ibiblio, or Terracotta could host its own repository and have users modify their Maven 2 settings.xml file.  Posting the jars on Ibiblio is preferrable.  Ideally you'd want to Mavenize the build first to streamline their footprint as well.

Cheers,
Jim

Jim, hopefully that will be covered by the mavenizing terracotta build.

In a mean time you should be able to create terracotta profile and point dependency to the local terracotta install. See http://maven.apache.org/general.html#tools-jar-dependency
