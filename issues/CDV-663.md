## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If GC is configured to run, pressing the run gc button in the console is denied by the server.  Let's explore why this is  - is there a way to let humans override the automatic and force it to run now or is this a bad idea?

Lets make it so that users can run DGC even if DGC is enabled in the config.

It should run if it is not currently running else and exception and a message is displayed.
