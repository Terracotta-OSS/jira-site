## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When you start up Ehcache 1.6.1 and it tries to read in the DiskStore files from 1.6, it fails with a ClassCastException because the new code expects to be deserializing a ConcurrentHashMap, but the old code serialized a Collections$SynchronizedMap.  My simple fix was to have the code deal properly with either type of Map - populating a new ConcurrentHashMap with the contents of the old Map if necessary.
