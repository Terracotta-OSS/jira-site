## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We are using maven2, and would like to depend on 
ehcache-constructs. However, there is no POM, and it 
is not on ibiblio.org.

Could it be put there, with the relevant dependencies?

Constructs has been rolled into ehcache-1.2.1. So easier to just keep adding the 
new ehcache versions.

Re-opening so that I can properly close out these issues and have correct Resolution status in Jira
