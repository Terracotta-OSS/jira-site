## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Terracotta.getLocalKeys() is used for the localReads behavior for calls like Cache.getKeys(). Even though it is local it still might be very large I think and probably shouldn't make a copy on each call. 

Where this copy happens: 
 
  org.terracotta.modules.ehcache.store.backend.BulkLoadBackend.getLocalKeys()
  com.terracotta.toolkit.collections.ConcurrentDistributedMapDsoArray.localKeySet()
