## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If you run a write behind setup without coalescing but with batching write behind can end up reordering puts and removes to the same key. When assembling batches write behind simply takes all writes amongst the selected operations and makes a write batch, and the same to form a delete batch. This logic should be corrected to prevent reordering of writes and deletes to the same key.
