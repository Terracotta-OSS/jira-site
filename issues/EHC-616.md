## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It looks like recovery doesn't clean up prepared xids...
Using BTM, on restarting the app, while using the same running L2, I get all the Xids from the previous run returned when the XAResource is being registered (GenericXAResourceProducer) with the TransactionManager
