## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I am trying to use EHCache with JDeveloper's OC4J and 
keep getting a ClassNotFoundException from the 
DiskStore.ExpireTask.resolveClass method.

The problem has to do with the class loaders used by 
the thread.  The thread is using the 
ContextClassLoader which, as best as I can tell, is 
using the System class loader as determined by the 
CLASSPATH for OC4J and not the application specific 
CLASSPATH.

If I simply put the ehcache-1.2beta2.jar file in the 
WEB-INF/lib directory of my war file I get a 
ClassNotFoundException looking for the 
net.sf.ehcache.Element class.  If I put the ehcache, 
commons-logging and log4j jar files in the CLASSPATH 
for OC4J, it then throws the ClassNotFoundException 
looking for the specific classes that were cached to 
disk when it is trying to reload them so they can be 
expired.  

A simple remove works fine, it is only on the expiring 
where it has the problem.

I also tried it on Tomcat 9.0.5.2 with the jars in the 
WEB-INF/lib of the war and I don't get the Exceptions, 
however I don't see the file shrink like I would 
expect it to.  I get log output that elements are 
being removed, but I don't see the file shrinking.  
This might be because it is a random access file and 
simply viewing the file doesn't work, I'm not sure.

Any insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
