## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We adorn L1 JMX ObjectNames with a node attribute that associates that bean with it's L1. Unfortuntely, WebSphere does the same thing for the same reason.

If we want to work with WebSphere we best consider changing the node attribute to something else, like tcNode.

Are you working on this already?

No, I'm still on the last WS test failure of out the 3. So far we haven't run into this problem in any tests. Not sure why it's working now since Gary's description gives the impression that it won't work at all.

No. This is a significant change that won't be backward-incompatible. Further, we're still not quite sure my description of the situation is correct. We don't have any of these problems with WAS, but it's still a mystery, as forum users do.

We need to review this more as to what it is that currently broken (example or test) and what it is that we're trying to fix

From the community member
Well after done some tests in dev environment, effectively disabling WAS default MBean Server implementation with 
Code:
-Djavax.management.builder.initial="" -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote 

does the job. I could successfully acces all terracotta MBean ehcache/hibernate information. 

But in production context, it isn't obviously impossible for me. 

What kind of reproductible test case could be helpful to you? Does a complete EAR with ehcache would be helpful? I think the focus is to be targetted on the WAS integration part not on the application level ?

do you have enough info in the forum post?

I don't know JMX so I don't understand the issue actually. Though the issue is related to websphere, the change would be likely in JMX in L1/L2 and GUI

I think it's best to discuss this potential non-backward compatible change

Hung, please schedule a meeting with Gary, Steve, and Tim to discuss

This was discussed at Transparency.
Per Gary is pretty big and needs further discussion.  Please setup meetings with Tim, Gary, Steve to discuss in the new year. We don't have to do this for fremantle but should have an idea of how we will do it, then can schedule it.

Discussed and are planning to add fix later this year, after testing and backward compatibility issues are identified

This remains in a pending state until it becomes a key issue in a deal/poc
