## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I cannot get the remote debugger to work and have not found anyone who has gotten it to work.  All I get are a bunch of "Cache size: 0" logs.  Since there is virtually no documentation I can't tell what I am doing wrong or if there is a bug.

I'm using 
"java -cp ehcache-1.4.1-remote-debugger.jar:backport-util-concurrent-3.0.jar net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RemoteDebugger test.xml cacheName"
