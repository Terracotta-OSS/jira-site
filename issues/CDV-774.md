## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Title says it all.


Mail extract :

I think there is a bug. If L1 has grabed a lock for ever, it will prevent other free locks from getting GCed. So if following conditions meet

1) L1 has a forever lock 
2) Same L1 later acquired another lock greedly and releases it once done
3) No other L1 in cluster ask for lock acquired in 2nd step.
4) In this case lock acquired in 2nd step will never be GCed on L1. Basically forever lock kind of halts Lock GC, number of locks held by L1 will keep increasing.
