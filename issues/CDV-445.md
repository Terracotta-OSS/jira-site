## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When testing a simple app I unplugged the network cable to see how TC would react to this. 
To my surprise the only thing I noticed on the TC client side were log statements in the client log files. 

After a while I pluged the network cable back in and the client was not able te reconnect to the server. The server actually stopped with the following mdg 

java.lang.AssertionError: Client connected before disconnecting : old Client state = ClientStateImpl[ChannelID=[3], ObjectIDSet2 [ Range(21000,21002)]] 
at com.tc.objectserver.l1.impl.ClientStateManagerImpl.startupClient(ClientStateManagerImpl.java:176) 
at com.tc.objectserver.handshakemanager.ServerClientHandshakeManager.notifyClientConnect(ServerClientHandshakeManager.java:90) 
at com.tc.objectserver.handler.ClientHandshakeHandler.handleEvent(ClienHandshakeHandler.java:22) 
at com.tc.async.impl.StageImpl$WorkerThread.run(StageImpl.java:140) 

How can a client react when losing the connection with the TC server? how does TC help?

It's supposed to just log this not crash the server. If this is crashing the server we should fix it in the 2.4.4 release. Not sure when this regression occured

Can we replicate this? And also add a new test to replicate once we figure out the issue.
