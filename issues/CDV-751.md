## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Based on forum page: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/1046.page

I recommended an additional demo for POJO clustering based on the following scenario:

 Scenario1:
1) App1 - Back-end engine (populates shared object A data)
2) App2 - GUI (displays graph from shared object A data)

Scenario2:
1) App1 - Back-end engine (uses shared object B data as input for every run)
2) App2 - GUI ( allows user to override values in shared object B data)
3) App1 - Back-end engine (uses "update" shared object B data as input for every run) 

The idea is to have a demo that can demonstrate how different applications can share an object.  All the demos in the POJO samples are for a single applications launched multiple times.

Important considerations pointed out in the forum include behaviour for the "root definition" and the "class loader".
