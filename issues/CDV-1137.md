## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

At present the index.xml used by the tim-get tool is 1.1MB in size (http://forge.terracotta.org/api/index.xml). Compressing that file with gzip and bzip2 takes it down to ~20KB and ~17KB respectively. 

Obviously the program/process for creating the index file needs to know how to compress it, and the tim-get tool needs to know how to decompress it. Can't imagine those will be stumbling blocks though. 

At \*worst\* the producer program can use a command line program to do the compression since we control the machine/environment that runs on. Using a gzip, zip, or bzip2 from the java side for tim-get is trivial. 

NOTE: for backwards compatibility I think we might still need to publish both a compressed and uncompressed version of the index file

I think it would be really nice to get this in Quintara.

Small suggestion here, we might not have to do compression if the web  
server on forge.terracotta.org supports gzip responses. This is part  
of the HTTP protocol by using the appropriate content encoding:
http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/compress/

We shouldn't be worrying about backwards compatibility in this case  
since everything that understands HTTP 1.1 should understand this.

It would also be beneficial for any other text files on that site.

I've got the tim get index generator to create both index.xml and index.xml.gz 

Just need to get the consumers of the index to do the unzip

tim-get is now reading a zip version of the index. Regular version of index.xml is still available and refresh along with the zipped one so that 2.7.x users can still use it

I wonder if we should merge this to 2.7 so we can get rid of the unzipped version altogether. Both branches will use zipped index
