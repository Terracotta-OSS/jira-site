## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

http://kong.terracotta.lan/output/archive/forge/tim-weblogic/archive-tim-weblogic-tc-3.1-s10fm0-20090729103350.zip is an example of these tests failing in the monkey

I tested this out locally and it does seem to fail everytime. I did this:

- Checked out https://svn.terracotta.org/repo/forge/projects/tim-weblogic/branches/tc-3.1 (rev 17962)
- set JAVA\_HOME to a 1.5 VM (weblogic 9 has to be run with 1.5)
- mvn -Psystem-tests integration-test -Dappserver=weblogic-9.2.mp3 -Dtest=RequestForwardTest

Not sure if this is a showstopper for stable 1 but definitely a regression for weblogic.

I just can't get these tests to run at all, on my Mac there's something going wrong with the java process execution. So I went to a linux dev machine and there any of the weblogic system tests just times out, even with tim-session from before my changes :-/

At what point does it time out? One thing it needs to do is to download the weblogic install (which is huge) but that happens before the test runs.

What is in the server\_[0|1].log?

Strangely it doesn't even get far enough to create those log files.

I worked around all this by running the system tests from tim-session directly, that seems to work ... strange enough.

Fixed in r17969 in 3.1 branch
and in r17970 in trunk
of tim-session
