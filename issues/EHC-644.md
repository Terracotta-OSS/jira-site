## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When a transaction is being prepared, while another one is commiting, that have at least 2 keys in common being accessed in "non-natural order of the locks" you end up with a deadlock. EhcacheXAResourceImpl#prepareCommand is simply iterating over the queued commands to lock on the oldVersionStore, while commit does (the proper!) getAndWriteLockAllSyncForKeys() call. That current situation creates the deadlock
