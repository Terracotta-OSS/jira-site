## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName property is ignored in 2.5.0.  

Configuration works just fine with previous versions.  Suddenly switches to using default ehcache.xml in 2.5.0.

Without knowing more about the exact environment here I can't be sure but I'm wondering if this might be related to the new requirement to name cache managers in 2.5.0.  If the config at the location specified by the \{\{net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName\}\} property doesn't define a name, and a cache manager has already been created from the default \{\{ehcache.xml\}\} in the same application then he'll get that manager since they will both have the default name.

I'm using this with Hibernate 3.3 and I don't see anything in the docs (http://www.ehcache.org/documentation/integrations/hibernate) about this.

What kind of environmental info do you need?

Could you try this as a quick solution (if you haven't already)...

Find the ehcache.xml file that you are referencing with your \{\{net.sf.ehcache.configurationResourceName\}\} property and add a \{\{name="foo"\}\} attribute to the \{\{<ehcache>\}\} element (you might want to pick a more logical name).  If my hunch is right then this should solve your problem.

Your ehcache.xml will then look something like this:

```
<ehcache name="hibernate-caching">
  <defaultCache maxElementsInMemory="0" eternal="true">
  </defaultCache>
</ehcache>
```
