## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I know this one is dumb and obvious.  It didn't trip me up because I know tim-get is a script but the website instructions for installing SVT say to run TC\_HOME/bin/tim-get install ...

it is so precise as to be misleading is my point.  You should either say "run tim-get" to install SVT or you should say "TC\_HOME/bin/tim-get.sh (.bat for windows)" if you are going to show a path to a command.

Just sayin'
