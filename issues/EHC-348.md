## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This is my bug.  I enclosed the wait for the heartbeat
interval inside the for loop that sends out chunked
multicast packets.  This effectively multiplies the
heartbeat interval by the number of chunks.

This source also includes the TTL configuration I
submitted earlier.
