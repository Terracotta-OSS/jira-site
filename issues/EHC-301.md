## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If multiple web apps (EARs or WARs) have been deployed to a single application server instance there will be no visibility between CacheManagers in each application since separate classloaders will be used. Is so, surely CacheManager.detectAndFixDiskStorePathConflict() will not spot the problem and will therefore allow multiple applications to use the same diskStorePath, presumably causing conflicts between the applications. A more flexible way of specifying the path in the configuration file would help, e.g. support of environment variables.
