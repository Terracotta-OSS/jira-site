## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

"diskPersistent" config parameter doesn't seem to have any effect on EHCache operation (1.3.0 and 1.4.0-beta). Instead MemoryStore's flush() method looks at "overflowToDisk" parameter. So it is impossible to have a memory only cache that is persisted between VM restarts.
