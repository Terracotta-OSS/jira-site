## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

 SVT takes too long to load any reasonably large data. We were waiting for 40+ minutes to load 1 hour data. This is because of the CSV format that we choose to send the data in. He parses them and recreates them in H2 database. Looking at the CSV format, it seems highly repetitive and inefficient. Don't know if we can just send the H2 database across and work with that instead.
