## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Cf http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/5936.page

An Active-Passive array is defined, Passive node starts in active mode, and gets zapped by the Active node. At restart, it tries again to start as active, and it never manages to go into Passive.

Wiping the L2 database doesn't improve the behaviour.

Logs and tc-config are attached.

@Aurie,

Can we get some thread dumps on both the servers while the second server is continuously getting zapped down ? I am not able to recreate this problem. I tried to recreate this and not able to. If you are able to recreate the problem, would suggest you to increase the election time and see if the problem is repeated

Upon analyzing the logs, i feel DEV-5941 could be the root cause for this issue.

Manoj,
Unfortunately I never managed to reproduce the error but the user seemed to be able to reproduce it easily, I see that you already posted on the forum, hopefully he'll able to send us some thread dumps.
