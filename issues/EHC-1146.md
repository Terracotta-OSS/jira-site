## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Statictics for Blocking Cache is invalid.
Statistics shows 2 misses in case of single blockingCache.get(nonExistingElementKey) invocation.

The issue happens because when blocking cache accesses the underlying cache it uses get instead of getQuiet. See net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.BlockingCache.get(Object) for details.
