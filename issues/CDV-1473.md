## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

GenericListTest won't catch this since the change has to be broadcast to an L1 to catch the problem (the list applicator doesn't know how to handle removeAll()). The server side is okay which is why the tests work 

To reproduce this:
 - create a clustered COWArrayList
 - fault it 2 or more nodes
 - call removeAll() on one node

The broadcast of the removeAll() to the other nodes will fail in the applicator
