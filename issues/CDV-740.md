## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

the thread dump entries in the tree control are too similar - there is one for the cluster, one per server, and one per client.  and they all have the same name.

I suggest:

Cluster Thread Dump
Server Thread Dump
Client Thread Dump



</div>

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Tested with Terracotta trunk-nightly-rev9063, as of 20080707-210708 (Revision 9063 by cruise@WXPMO0 from trunk), Thread dump entries are changed into Cluster thread dumps, Server thread dumps and Client thread dumps in the admin console as expected.

</div>
