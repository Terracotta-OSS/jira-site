## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi, 
I would like perform a query as: 
Code:
 Query query = bigMemory.createQuery();
 query.includeAttribute(fullname)
 .includeAttribute(address)
 .addGroupBy(fullname, address)
 .includeAggregator(Aggregators.count())
 .maxResults(1000)
 .orderBy(aggregator????);
 

I would like sort using the field/element "aggregator". 

I would like to sort using the field/element "aggregator". 

It would be usefull to have a column alias for the aggregation and later reference it in the order by clause.

best regards, 
dario

We do not support aliasing for aggregators in general. This was noted in the original spec doc for the GroupBy feature (see the example with ORDER BY clause): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UxEeBKCuAcVobUZeObEmcIMJPQXRZKB399zaZzsnYvw/edit?usp=sharing

Not sure what the overall LOE would be, but certainly seems like too big a change for GA.
