## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

If an HTTP response has its Content-type header set via directly calling setHeader("Content-type", <...>) on an HttpServletResponse instead of calling setContentType, the Content-type header will be ignored when serving the cached response, because HttpServletResponse's setContentType will be called nevertheless by CachingFilter::setContentType.
