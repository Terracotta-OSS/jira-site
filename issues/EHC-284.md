## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

First, thanks for making ehcache distributed. It is 
really helping us a lot.

To help me explain the feature I'm requesting, let me 
describe a bit about our setup:
\* Two web servers both using hibernate and ehcache - 
call them A and B.
\* Two network interfaces from each server - say IP 
addresses 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2. 1.1.1.1 is used for 
HTTP traffic with the public internet and 2.2.2.2 is 
routed for internal communication only (e.g. talking 
to the database server).

For security reasons, we would like to ensure that 
ehcache listens only on interface 2.2.2.2 and that 
all traffic between the servers goes over the 
internal route. Hence we put this in ehcache.xml:
<cacheManagerPeerProviderFactory 
class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeer
ProviderFactory"
      properties="peerDiscovery=automatic, 
multicastGroupAddress=230.0.0.1, 
multicastGroupPort=4234"/>
<cacheManagerPeerListenerFactory 
class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeer
ListenerFactory"
       properties="port=41234, hostName=2.2.2.2, 
socketTimeoutMillis=120000"/>
We also route 230.0.0.1 to go over the internal 
interface and not the external one.

Looking at the traffic with tcpdump, we do in fact 
see that all the ehcache inter-server traffic (both 
unicast and multicast) is going over the internal 
network. However, netstat tells us that ehcache is 
listening on \_all\_ interfaces - which isn't what we 
want. (We do block the unicast port at our external 
firewall, but would rather not even be listening on 
that port at the server.)

The methods getUrl() and getUrlBase() in the class 
RMICachePeer use the hostName parameter, which 
appears to be causing the actual \_traffic\_ among the 
clustered servers to pass over the desired interface. 
However, the server socket factory passed to 
UnicastRemoteObject (the parent class) in the 
RMICachePeer constructor doesn't use this hostName 
parameter, so the server socket it creates listens on 
all interfaces.

The fix would be (I think!) to create a server socket 
factory similar to 
ConfigurableRMIClientSocketFactory, and pass this 
factory to the UnicastRemoteObject constructor. The 
new factory would construct an InetAddress from the 
hostName parameter and then use the ServerSocket(int 
port, int backlog, InetAddress bindAddr) constructor 
to create the desired socket that listens only on the 
given interface. (Note that this constructor is 
available all the way back to Java 1.3 - see 
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/net/ServerS
ocket.html.)

I'd be happy to try writing and submitting a patch 
that does this but would need someone to review it 
carefully as I have not written much networking code 
before. I'd also need to know your preferred patch 
format and whether there is anything special about 
building ehcache.jar (I don't see an Ant build file 
in the distribution I have).
