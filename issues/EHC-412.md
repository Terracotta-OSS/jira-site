## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

This page: http://ehcache.org/documentation/samples.html

Has a bunch of examples for the stats like:

Cache cache = manager.getCache("sampleCache1");
int hits = cache.getHitCount();

but I think these should really be more like:

Cache cache = manager.getCache("sampleCache1");
Statistics stats = cache.getStatistics();
int hits = stats.getHitCount();
