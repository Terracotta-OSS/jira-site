## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When starting a server with a config that has more than one server element, it is required to start the server with a server name, e.g.

$ start-tc-server.sh -n foo

Where 'foo' is the name of the server.

The server should log which element was selected in the startup logs, e.g:

2008-12-11 11:22:14,108 [main] INFO com.terracottatech.general - Server started as "foo"



</div>
