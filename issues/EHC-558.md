## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I checked

http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/ehcache/trunk/web/src/main/java/net/sf/ehcache/constructs/web/GenericResponseWrapper.java

which still has the bug (ie, setHeader calling addHeader).  Am I
looking in the wrong place?

Thanks,
Ben

Have you tested trunk of ehcache-web. We fixed a set headers issue. Should
be released this week. It would be good if you can check that trunk fixes
your issue.

Hi, Greg.

I came across a bug in ehcache-web the other day whereby the setHeader
method of the GenericResponseWrapper class incorrectly calls addHeader
instead of overwriting any existing value for the given HTTP header.
I've written a patch along with a unit test that I believe fixes the
problem.

I noticed the problem via the GzipFilter class, which uses the
GenericResponseWrapper class internally.

Please let me know if this issue should be directed elsewhere or if
you have any questions.

Thanks,
Ben
