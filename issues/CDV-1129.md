## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In the DSO Eclipse plug-in, a launch configuration can be created that specifies a BootClassPath entry.  The Run as DSO Application feature will blindly add the required Terracotta bootjar and, depending on the relative ordering, one or the other entry will not be recognized.  The plug-in should recognize an existing BootClassPath entry and piggyback on it instead of adding a new entry.

A workaround is to manually include the Terracotta bootjar in the custom entry.
