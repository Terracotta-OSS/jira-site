## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

JCacheManager subclasses CacheManager.  The static shutdown() method (and create() methods) in CacheManager lock against CacheManager.class.  JCacheManager's shutdown() does this:

    public void shutdown() {
        synchronized (JCacheManager.class) {
            if (status.equals(Status.STATUS\1SHUTDOWN)) {
                if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {
                    LOG.debug("CacheManager already shutdown");
                }
                return;
            }
            super.shutdown();
            //only delete singleton if the singleton is shutting down.
            if (this == singleton) {
                singleton = null;
            }
        }
    }

I think the intent here is to be locked against the same locks held in the JCacheManager.create() method which also uses CacheManager.class as a lock.  I think the one use of JCacheManager.class should be changed to CacheManager.class.
