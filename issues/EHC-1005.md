## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Methods that do lock/unlock reference this.lock which could lead to false sharing... Should put them on the stack. Not saying the JIT doesn't already fix most usages, but given the code, seems like a "small enough" optimization to do, which \_might even\_ help sometimes...
