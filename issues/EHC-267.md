## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

We've recently converted our application to use EhCache
as the 2nd-level cache for Hibernate.  During high
cache load, we have found that the system experienced
CPU usage and load average spikes (8 CPU Sun Solaris) -
disabling the disk store removed these spikes.

After reviewing the code, it appears that the
thread-per-store, combined with polling and excessive
locking are the culprits.

Proposing a few modifications that will improve
DiskStore performance, and allow for greater
extensiblity.  Interested in feedback from the EhCache
maintainers before we start to work on these changes.

1) Add support for pluggable disk stores.  The
high-level steps for this are:
    a) Create a DiskStore interface;
    b) Modify configuration to accept a disk store
implementation class;
    c) Modify Cache.java to create appropriate disk store

2) Create alternate DiskStore implementation;
high-level design:
    a) Use the same concepts as existing store
(RandomAccessFile, in memory and persistent index);
    b) Create a Java 5 ThreadPoolExecutor (fallback to
a Java 1.4 compatible equivalent - util.concurrent) for
spooling of objects; this would result in a pool of
threads to spool objects (vs the existing
thread-per-store polling method).
    c) Remove / reduce synchronization on get(); this
will be accomplished by using concurrent hash maps and
RandomAccessFile.fileChannel(); a Java 1.4
implementation will also be provided (not as performant).

Thoughts?
