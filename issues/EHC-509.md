This is as designed. When the license expires, the GUI stops working and a modal Ajax dialog pops up to prevent the user from using the GUI. This also makes sense since neither the server nor the probes return any information anymore. The close button on the Ajax dialog has on purpose been removed. The browser window with the Ajax dialog can be closed though.
