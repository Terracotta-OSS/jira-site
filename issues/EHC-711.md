## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Steps
--------
Deploy Ehcache Server in Tomcat as per instructions on http://ehcache.org/documentation/cache\1server.html

Use jconsole to connect to Tomcat.

Observations
------------------
Ehcache MBeans are not visible

Expected Behavior
----------------------------
1. Ehcache MBeans should be visible

Additional Notes
----------------------

Upon investigating further, found out that net.sf.ehcache.server.ServerContext, in the contextInitialized() API

the code is 

 MBeanServer mBeanServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
        managementService = new ManagementService(CacheManager.getInstance(), mBeanServer,
                true, true, true, true);

This costruct doesn't register the MBean

When the code updated as follows, the Ehcache MBeans were visible 

MBeanServer mBeanServer = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
        managementService = new ManagementService(CacheManager.getInstance(), mBeanServer,
                true, true, true, true);
        managementService.init(); // This line was added


BTW, the same is not working for standalone version as well.
