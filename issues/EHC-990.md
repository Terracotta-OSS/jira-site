## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Ehcache configuration should clearly and correctly distinguish between dynamic and static configuration attributes.  It should also correctly enforce the static-ness of the static attributes so that they cannot be mutated at "runtime".  Of course exactly what all this means might be hard to define given how the lifecycle of a configuration object is currently kind of complex.  With that in mind it may make sense to schedule this work to be done at the same time as a wider overhaul of the configuration lifecycle.
