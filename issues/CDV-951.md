## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

A graphical GUI dashboard and a RESTful interface have to allow real-time stats to be displayed for the entire cluster by directly connecting to the L2 without having an admin console.

This should have no impact when the stats are not displayed and should be available immediately on a running system without previous configuration.

</div>
