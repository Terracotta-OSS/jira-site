## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

ehcache 1.2.2 does not shutdown properly when used with
hibernate 3.1.3 due to RMICachePeer objects which were
unbound but not unexported.  The reason for this is
found in the
net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheManagerPeerListener
class.  What we saw was that the notifyCacheRemoved
method was called before dispose().  Thanks to the
debugs it appeared as if all of the RMICachePeers were
being removed successfully.  Unfortunately,
notifyCacheRemoved removes the RMICachePeer from the
list of cachePeers and unbinds it, but does NOT
unexport it.  This means that dispose never gets a
chance to run the local unbind method which both
unbinds and unexports the RMICachePeers.  It also means
that the non daemon RMI Reaper will not allow any
application using ehcache's distributed caching to
shutdown until those unbound, but still exported
RMICachePeer objects, are garbage collected.  Greg,
attached is the RMICacheManagerPeerListener that Peter
Chiang modified.  Among the modifications is improved
unexport handling in case the exported object is busy.
 In our testing these changes have corrected the
shutdown issue and do not appear to introduce any new bugs.

BTW thanks for the distributed cache enhancement...
this feature has proven VERY useful and quite stable:)
