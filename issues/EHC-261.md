## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

A feature I would like to see is a structured way to
extend 
the expiry mechanism, so as to implement domain sensitive
expiry.

That is to say, instead of having "expiry" dependent
solely upon timestamp and a time-to-live, have it
depend upon business logic.

e.g.    cached statistics dependent upon a cached dataset.
If the dataset is changed the cached statistics are
marked to expire.

Perhaps a modular expiry logic that you can plug into 
net.sf.ehcache.Cache, without having to necessarily
extend Cache.

Yuji,

Ehcache-1.2 has CacheEventListeners. You could register your own listener to 
add your own business logic. 

In your example you could receive notification of an update event. You could 
achieve  "expiry" by then removing the Element.
