<div markdown="1" class="comment">

TCObject.resolveAllReferences() is probably being called when clone() is invoked on these collections, but it doesn't do anything. There should probably be an interface added on our implementation of collections (kinda like Clearable) that gives TCObjectLogical a way to get all references resolved.
