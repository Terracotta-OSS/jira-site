## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In some cases, if the L1 is killed ungracefully (kill -9), the L1 does not release the lock on the L1 Statistics Store. This is more relevant in Weblogic deployments where due to hot deploy issues, sometimes the admin has to kill -9 the process. The workaround today is to delete the store. It would be great to have a way to turn off Statistics store all together.
