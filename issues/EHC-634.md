## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

When I look at the timestamp cache statistics in the hibernate/second-level-cache page, I see that there are no misses for o.h.c.UpdateTimestampsCache (see attached screenshot).

Yet, when I look at the same cache in the ehcache pane, then I see that there ARE misses.  (See attached screenshot)

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

Hibernate 3.3.2 and probably all other versions of Hibernate don't ever update the SecondLevelCacheStatistics object for the UpdateTimestampsCache.  This means the numbers in the Hibernate/Second-Level-Cache page in the dev-console for hits, misses and puts on the UpdateTimestampsCache will always be zero.  We could think about submitting this as a bug to the Hibernate developers although what our chances of it getting fixed are I don't know.

Snaps has had some success getting patches into hibernate in the past. Maybe he has an idea.

I certainly think that providing the bug report \_and\_ the patch will raise our chances.
I'll be investigating how critical these guys see it. And also look into how hard it is to provide the said patch...

assigning back to Alex to see if we can get the patch checked into Hibernate. 
We will not be showing this stat in the dev console so it is not critical right now.

I created this in their JIRA,
http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-5326 
and launched a couple of alternative paths, will see whether it makes sense. The patch seems pretty easy to implement...

Fixed it again in 4.0, sent a pull request... We'll see. If that isn't happening, this will be a "Won't fix"
