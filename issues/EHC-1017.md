## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I'd like to try serializing data using one of the [serialization libraries|https://github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers/wiki] available today for the jvm, i.e. [kryo|https://code.google.com/p/kryo/], but this scenario seems not supported for ehcache.

Having a way to configure an ad-hoc serialization strategy per cache \*could lead to interesting performance improvements\*.

This issue originated from [the forum|http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/8115.page].

Please note alternative serialization strategies seems quite promising: I've just shared [a raw micro-benchmark|http://h2-database.66688.n3.nabble.com/Any-chance-to-achieve-better-performances-for-OTHER-columns-through-jboss-serialization-library-tp4026037p4026809.html] for H2 db.
I'd do the same for ehcache if I only had a way to inject a custom serialization policy.

Chris, does this seem like a contributor agreement community thing?
