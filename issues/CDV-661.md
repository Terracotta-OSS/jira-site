## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The two reconnect windows are not very easy to decipher what is what - to a novice user it is unclear what setting controls what behavior.

Worse, the client reconnect window (not the client reconnect on server failover window) is specified in the tc.properties, which is not where it should be it.

It should be in the tc-config.xml.
