## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Today, one has to specify the following:

<clients>
  <modules>
    <module name="tim-ehcache" version="1.2.3" />
  </modules>
</clients>

Where 1.2.3 is a version that corresponds to a version that the user wants to use, but it has to match the version of Terracotta that is selected at runtime.   

Instead, it would be nice to be able to specify:
<clients>
  <modules>
    <module name="tim-ehcache" />
  </modules>
</clients>


The behavior of this would be defined as "use the tim-get index file that tells tim-get what the most up-to-date version of a particular tim is for the selected version of Terracotta, use that version"

That does imply a network/remote dependency for starting the L1 which could be problematic

Tim, I don't think so.  I don't think this means \*downloading\* a tim, it just means using the newest or best version of the tim you already have in your local modules repo.  

BTW, I think there is a hidden part of this that affects tim-to-tim dependencies.  One of our big problems is needing to re-release downstream tims when a tim gets version bumped.  If we could make those dependencies also "do the right thing" and not based on hard versions, then we start to see a big win.  So, tim-tomcat says "I use tim-sessions" and you can bump a new version of tim-sessions w/o needing a new version of tim-tomcat as well.  That aspect probably requires moving off of osgi and taking a more tolerant approach towards versioning (since version dependencies are hard-coded into tims and loaded by osgi, not our code).  

I'd like to see tim-get know enough to give you versions that work for your tc install and the runtime be smart enough to get the best one of those versions (both for top-level and dependent tims).
