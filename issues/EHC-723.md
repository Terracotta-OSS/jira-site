## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

- status: should probably be made volatile as modified recently in MemoryStore. Right now there does not seem to be concurrent access / modification but there could be in the future.

- active: should be made volatile, it is subject to multi-threaded access.

- totalSize: should be replaced by AtomicLong. It is being incremented/decremented concurrently and these operations are not atomic, leading to lost updates and/or incorrect calculations.

- lastElementSize: should be made volatile, bufferFull() and writeElement() can access this concurrently. Since this is only used for rough estimates it does not seem critical though.

Not in any significant way.  The old DiskStore (which this issue relates to) is only used when the user requests the old LinkedHashMap based LRU store via the magic system property.  In any case even if they do this, this bug (and the others recently filed) are not new.
