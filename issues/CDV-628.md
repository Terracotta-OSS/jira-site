## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

From the forums http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/803.page#4766

"I've got a most annoying problem. I run Windows XP and Eclipse (latest) and the TC eclipse plugin (latest) 

Sometimes when I start eclipse it starts "reloading DSO configuration". This task never finishes and it is not possible to cancel it (I can click the "cancel" button alright but to no avail) "...

from GKeim response: I think one way you can work around this problem until I figure it out is to keep the Config Editor open. When changes to the config occur, since the Config Editor is open, it will not save your config file. Thus, it will not try to reload it.

Does the above mean that it will be (or already is) fixed?

It was a deadlock.
