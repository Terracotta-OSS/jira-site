## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

JMX classes should not be referred when monitoring="off"

The SampledMBeanRegistrationProvider is created eagerly in MBeanRegistrationProviderImpl constructor. Should lazily create it and only if monitoring="on" or (monitoring="auto-detect" and tc is running).
