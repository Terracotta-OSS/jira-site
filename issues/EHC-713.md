## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

The existing configuration generator is hardcoded and new elements added to the xsd are not generated if one forgets to modify the configuration generator.
It is hard to write a test that exposes this too right now as its hardcoded and gives string output.
Clean it up, expose new elements that are not generated after added to xsd etc.
