## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Someone commented the following. Seems like a good idea:

You could eliminate step 7 (which is adding the Terracotta Nature)  if the Pojo archetype added the Terracotta nature automatically (or configure the maven-eclipse-plugin in your pom.xml to add project nature org.terracotta.dso.ProjectNature). This way eclipse:eclipse will add the nature automatically.

What happens if the end-user doesn't have the Terracotta eclipse plugin installed - horror of horrors! :)

I agree - this seems fraught with peril. :)  But it's an interesting idea.

I'm not sure that is really a big deal. I think eclipse handles it reasonably when you load a project with a nature it doesn't have. Could be wrong though.
