## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Users have encountered class verifier errors when instrumenting obfuscated classes, such as com/sun/crypto/provider/SunJCE\_m:

http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/344.page

The work-around is to exclude those classes from instrumentation:

<instrumented-classes>
 <exclude>com.sun.crypto.provider..\*</exclude> 
</instrumented-classes>


</div>

In my recollection that happens only on early Sun's 1.5 JRE and been fixed in later versions...

Add this exclude to all sample session files and configurator default files etc.

I think we could/should be able to always exclude the sun crypto classes by applying the appropriate excludes via the modules-common config-bundle.

We could also have a config-bundle specifically for excluding classes that we can not instrument. And make it so that this bundle is always loaded/started when an l1 starts.
