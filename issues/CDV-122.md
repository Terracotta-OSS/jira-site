## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It's unclear what the use case for this is, but right now, one cannot take an instance of an Iterator and share it in a DSO graph. For one thing, the actual implementation class is probably actually one a com.tc.\* wrapper class (which makes it impossible to instrument in user level config).

If we decide to work on supporting this, we should decide if the act of sharing an iterator of an unshared collection causing that collection to be come shared. I can't see how it wouldn't, but that question probably isn't obvious at first, and needs a decision and tests to back it up the decision. 

This would apply to all collection classes, implying a good handful of tests
