## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I have Terracotta server and clients - environment for all are same. I configured one client JVM to use 7000m (-Xms1024m -Xmx7000m -XX: -UseGCOverheadLimit) but exactly it has only 4GB of RAM.

After Terracotta client node reaches more than 4GB of ram it is disconnect from Terracotta server but it is still running properly.

We'll look into this in the future - in general it is not good practice to give the JVM more heap than physical ram.

I know that this is not a good way but when you have developer's machine with 4GB RAM and you need to index huge amount of data and store it in memory then you have no choice and should use page memory.
