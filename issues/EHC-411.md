## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

With ehcache-terracotta in 1.7, we are reusing the "disk" config elements and stats to mean the Terracotta L2 server.  We initially thought this was a reasonable mapping but since we've had some regrets as even the developers working on it have gotten confused.  Need to re-evaluate whether creating new config elements would be clearer and make more sense.

Requires changes to config schema
