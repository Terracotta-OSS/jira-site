## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

.data file doesn't get truncated when elements are evicted from disk storage.

Cache configuration has overflowToDisk="true" and diskPersistent="false".

Suppose there is an element on disk (disk only) with key "Key1". When remove("Key1") method is called on this cache, the element is seemingly removed from the cache. But the entry for the key in .data file is not removed.

Consequently, the size of .data file keeps increasing.

The documentation doesn't mention this behavior. Is it suppose to be like this?

Is this a real issue? Should we do something about it?

<div markdown="1" class="comment">

The space on the disk being used by the deleted entry is returned for the pool. The disk file does not shrink but the space or some part of it gets reused.

So I don't think this is a bug.
