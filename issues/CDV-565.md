## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It may be impossible to tell, considering wildcard matching patterns, but then again, it may also be possible to tell, that an autolock configuration will not have any effect.

In any case, it may be useful to be able to emit a WARNING that notes when an autolock specification will not have any effect.

This suggestion came from a forum post here: http://forums.terracotta.org/forums/posts/list/601.page

This needs more specification before anyone should do something with it. The only reasonable thing I can think to generate a log statement for is if autolocking is being applied to method that either (a) contains no synchronized blocks or (b) the method access is not "synchronized". It's not possible to know (at instrumentation time) if the object being synchronized on will be shared or not. I also think this should this logging should be on by default. I think this belongs in the category of optional instrumentation logging (/tc:tc-config/clients/dso/debugging/instrumentation-logging)
