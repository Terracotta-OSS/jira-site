## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Hi,

I have been using ehcache for a long time already, but I just recently came across this handy Servlet Filter.

Caching worked fine out of the box, but there is a problem with the encoding of the ResponseWrapper.

My pages write in Japanese (Shift\1JIS), but the writer given to my JSPs does not seem to take care of the encoding.

net.sf.ehcache.constructs.web.GenericResponseWrapper says:

public PrintWriter getWriter() {
    if (writer == null) {
        writer = new PrintWriter(outstr, true);
    }
    return writer;
}

I changed the writer to:

    public PrintWriter getWriter() {
        if (writer == null) {
         if (getCharacterEncoding() != null) {
          try {
     writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(outstr, getCharacterEncoding()), true);
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
     LOG.error("UnsupportedEncodingException blah blah", e);
     writer = new PrintWriter(outstr, true);
    }
         } else {
          writer = new PrintWriter(outstr, true);
         }
        }
        return writer;
    }

and my page is displayed in Japanese.


Best regards,
