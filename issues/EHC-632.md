## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

It seems to me that to make it easier for users to use write-through and write-behind we should add an AbstractCacheWriter class since there enough boilerplate methods for this to be annoying.

I'd normally just add it, but given the state of the release, do I Jira it for a next release?

public abstract class AbstractCacheWriter implements CacheWriter \{
 public void write(Element element) throws CacheException \{
   throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
 \}

 public void writeAll(Collection<Element> elements) throws CacheException \{
   throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
 \}

 public void delete(CacheEntry entry) throws CacheException \{
   throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
 \}

 public void deleteAll(Collection<CacheEntry> entries) throws CacheException \{
   throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
 \}

 public CacheWriter clone(Ehcache cache) throws CloneNotSupportedException \{
   throw new CloneNotSupportedException();
 \}

 public void init() \{
   // no-op
 \}

 public void dispose() throws CacheException \{
   // no-op
 \}
\}
