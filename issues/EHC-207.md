## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

In RMISynchronousCacheReplicator.java, line 129, replicatePutNotification method:

There is a for loop that iterates through all the peers, trying to "put" against each one. When the first "put" fails, the exception will bubble up. Thus, the "put" is never attempted to peers after the first one that fails. I think you should try against all peers - it doesn't make sense (to me, at least) that if one peer fails, that all peers that happen to be in the list after that one should never receive the replication messages.
