## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I was under the impression that if a root field is requested in a class that doesn't contain that field, we are supposed to emit a warning.

Here is a way to reproduce this (not) happening:

1) checkout the helloclusteredworld source recipe:
 svn co http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/forge/cookbook/helloclusteredworld

2) edit the tc-config.xml so that it has a typo - e.g. couter not counter

3) run the sample.  clustering no longer works since the field name no longer is correct.  

Expected:

Product emits a warn to the console and to the log file

Actual:

No message

Per CDV-237 which appears to be working correctly, I don't think this is a regression (I tried it with 2.7.3 and 3.0).  I noticed one difference is that 237 is testing a reference, while this case the root is a literal - so that might be it?
