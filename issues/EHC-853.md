## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Referring to this code in \{\{Timestamper.java\}\}:
\{noformat\}
    public static long next() {
        int runs = 0;
        while (true) {
            if (runs++ > 0 && LOG.isInfoEnabled()) {
                LOG.info("Thread spin-waits on time to pass. Looped "
                         + runs + " times, you might want to increase -Dnet.sf.ehcache.util.Timestamper.shift");
            }
            long base = System.currentTimeMillis() << BIN_DIGITS;
            long maxValue = base + ONE_MS - 1;

            for (long current = VALUE.get(), update = Math.max(base, current + 1); update < maxValue;
                 current = VALUE.get(), update = Math.max(base, current + 1)) {
                if (VALUE.compareAndSet(current, update)) {
                    return update;
                }
            }
        }
    }
\{noformat\}
I have no idea how exactly it happened, but we saw this error message:
\{noformat\}
Thread spin-waits on time to pass. Looped 1563731743 times,
  you might want to increase -Dnet.sf.ehcache.util.Timestamper.shift
\{noformat\}

\*If this code can ever possibly loop a billion times, it's by definition broken.\*

Replace the too-fancy CAS hack with a simple \{\{synchronized\}\} statement.

My guess is that the clock was set backwards (behavior that any user of \{\{System.currentTimeMillis()\}\} must be prepared to handle) and so the inner loop only looped one time.

But it doesn't matter. This algorithm is broken... nothing provably guarantees that a thread will ever exit this method. Just because it seems like that would never happen you can't assume it won't. Obviously it did once, at least for a billion loops (same as infinity as far as I'm concerned).

I just realized (duh) that when time goes backwards, the \{\{compareAndSet()\}\} is never even attempted.

So this code is even more broken than I thought.

Basically, if time goes backwards, every thread that enters this method goes into an infinite loop until the clock catches back up to where it was.

As observed in EHC-777 we are reluctant to revert to a synchronized solution since the original move to a CASing approach was due to this code being a bottleneck in performance testing.  A revert here would therefore result in a performance degradation.  However I think there are three things that we can fix here:

# We should ensure that spin-wait logging is only done on exit from the method when the final spin count is known - this will prevent us from spamming peoples logs with this message.
# We should (and can) detect the backwards clock movement and log it's occurrence.  In a well configured NTP client backwards shifts are usually avoided at all costs (skewing is preferred).
# We should allow users to configure the subsequent behavior after the clock drifts backwards, three immediately obvious choices are:
## Sleep until the system clock has caught up (this is the 'most correct' behavior since it prevents the timestamp values from moving backwards or being duplicated).
## Immediately cut to the new clock value.
## Repeat the current timestamp value on every request until the system clock has caught up.

The last two behaviors could both cause stale data visibility/corruption effects in Hibernate.  I'm sure there are many more potential behaviors that I've not listed, and I'm also not sure which one of these is the best default behavior.

\*Comment #1\*

I definitely agree with your #1 (hard to argue with reducing spam).

\*Comment #2\*

I don't know how this class is used so this next comment may be mis-informed.

Anyway, it seems to me that the underlying problem here is that we are attempting to create a single \{\{long\}\} value which is both (a) a timestamp and (b) unique.

Things would get much simpler if the goals of (a) and (b) were split, i.e., into two separate fields.

Then timestamping is easy, just invoke \{\{System.currentTimeMillis()\}\}, and uniqueness is easy, just invoke \{\{AtomicLong.incrementAndGet()\}\}.

\*Comment #3\*

If there is a requirement that the timestamps in (a) never go backwards, then this is a separate sub-problem, and it should be solved separately. See for example \{\{[SafeClock|http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E15357\_01/coh.360/e15725/com/tangosol/util/SafeClock.html]\}\} (never used this but found it via google). Either a proper solution like that should be included, or Ehcache should clearly document "this code doesn't work if your clock goes backwards".

But this also brings up the question: is the timestamp used to record \_absolute time\_, or simply used to compute \_time intervals\_? I'm guessing the latter. If so, then the solution is to use \{\{[System.nanoTime()|http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime%28%29]\}\} instead of \{\{System.currentTimeMillis()\}\} and the backwards clock problem disappears.

Timestamper now:
 - handles time going back, slewing threads to catch up on previously highest value
 - logs only every second at most if we spin

Performance is now slightly lower, but we're still around ~3x faster than the original implementation. (Used to be ~3.7x)
