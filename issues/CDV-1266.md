## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Need to come up with some text that doesn't lead people to add unnecessary stuff to the tc config.
See below
-----

Installing tim-tomcat-5.5 1.0.1 and dependencies... 
INSTALLED: tim-tomcat-5.5 1.0.1 - Ok 
INSTALLED: tim-tomcat-common 1.0.1 - Ok 
SKIPPED: tim-session-common 1.0.0 - Already installed 

Done. (Make sure to update your tc-config.xml with the new/updated version if necessary) 

C:\temp> 

so people may think 'dependencies' in message means that it's necessary to add 'tim-tomcat-common' and 'tim-session-common' 
in <modules> element. 
now i know 'dependencies' means just those modules need to be exist in appropriate path by reading Steve's post.

Maybe we can just repeat at the end what the tim-get info command states in the configuration section, e.g., we could add.

Done.

To configure the TIM for use in your application, update tc-config.xml with the following:

      <modules>
         <module name="{name}" version="{version}" />
      </modules>
