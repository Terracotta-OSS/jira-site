## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

Basically putting this here as a placeholder to consider the performance implications of the searching actions in the monitor.  Definitely could be issues with OOME or a performance impact.  I think the feature is really useful and supports key use cases but we need to figure out the right way to safeguard it.  Might need more warnings or ability to shut it off.
