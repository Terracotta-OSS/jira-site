<div markdown="1" class="comment">

I'll make it so the splitter can go all the way to the left.  The Statistics page is getting big due to the additional of new stats that have long names.  We currently have 3 columns of stat names, which I'll change to 2.  Also, the "Export configuration..." and "Import configuration..." button labels are contributing to the size.

Retested on osxmo2 mac machine with Terracotta 2.6-nightly-rev7902, as of 20080403-110444 (Revision 7902 by cruise@rh4mo0 from 2.6), it is working as expected.
