## Description

<div markdown="1" class="description">

I register CacheEventListener on EHCache in order to get notification about expiry of the element. I have low time to idle set to 10 sec. I put an element and wait longer than 10 sec and do not see notifyElementExpired() called. When I do a get on the element after a long time, it tells me it was not found and it fires notifyElementExpired at that time.

I am looking for a Java cache that will give me real time notification of expiry. Is this a bug or a intentional design of EHCache? Can it be modified with configuration parameter.

Thanks,

Jacek Korycki

Hi

I think we exchanged email on this. Element expiry is lazy, but you can create a CacheExtension which will regularly iterate through the cache, thus triggering expiries. That will work for you implementation. 

As this is an intentional design feature I will close this bug.
